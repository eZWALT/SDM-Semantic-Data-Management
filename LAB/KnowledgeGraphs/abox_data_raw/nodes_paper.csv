Meditation apps are the most commonly used mental health apps for depression and anxiety. However, little is known about who is well suited to these apps. Objective This study aimed to develop and test a data-driven algorithm to predict which individuals are most likely to benefit from app-based meditation training. Methods Using randomized controlled trial data comparing a 4-week meditation app (Healthy Minds Program [HMP]) with an assessment-only control condition in school system employees (n=662), we developed an algorithm to predict who is most likely to benefit from HMP. Baseline clinical and demographic characteristics were submitted to a machine learning model to develop a “Personalized Advantage Index” (PAI) reflecting an individual’s expected reduction in distress (primary outcome) from HMP versus control. Results A significant group × PAI interaction emerged (t658=3.30; P=.001), indicating that PAI scores moderated group differences in outcomes. A regression model that included repetitive negative thinking as the sole baseline predictor performed comparably well. Finally, we demonstrate the translation of a predictive model into personalized recommendations of expected benefit. Conclusions Overall, the results revealed the potential of a data-driven algorithm to inform which individuals are most likely to benefit from a meditation app. Such an algorithm could be used to objectively communicate expected benefits to individuals, allowing them to make more informed decisions about whether a meditation app is appropriate for them.

As a result, automatic text summarization is being employed in a range of industries to assist individuals in identifying the most important information. For text summarization, two approaches are mainly considered: text summarization by the extractive and abstractive methods. The extractive summarisation approach selects chunks of sentences like source documents, while the abstractive approach can generate a summary based on mined keywords. For low-resourced languages, e.g., Urdu, extractive summarization uses various models and algorithms. However, the study of abstractive summarization in Urdu is still a challenging task. Because there are so many literary works in Urdu, producing abstractive summaries demands extensive research. Methodology This article proposed a deep learning model for the Urdu language by using the Urdu 1 Million news dataset and compared its performance with the two widely used methods based on machine learning, such as support vector machine (SVM) and logistic regression (LR). The results show that the suggested deep learning model performs better than the other two approaches. The summaries produced by extractive summaries are processed using the encoder-decoder paradigm to create an abstractive summary. Results With the help of Urdu language specialists, the system-generated summaries were validated, showing the proposed model’s improvement and accuracy.",NA,True,"['Medicine', 'Computer Science']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0000315635be19f6278dbc72597b3065fac405f0

However, up to date, there is no cost-effective system to monitor insect presence accurately and insect-plant interactions. This paper presents results on the implementation of near-infrared spectroscopy (NIR) and a low-cost electronic nose (e-nose) coupled with machine learning. Several artificial neural network (ANN) models were developed based on classification to detect the level of infestation and regression to predict insect numbers for both e-nose and NIR inputs, and plant physiological response based on e-nose to predict photosynthesis rate (A), transpiration (E) and stomatal conductance (gs). Results showed high accuracy for classification models ranging within 96.5–99.3% for NIR and between 94.2–99.2% using e-nose data as inputs. For regression models, high correlation coefficients were obtained for physiological parameters (gs, E and A) using e-nose data from all samples as inputs (R = 0.86) and R = 0.94 considering only control plants (no insect presence). Finally, R = 0.97 for NIR and R = 0.99 for e-nose data as inputs were obtained to predict number of insects. Performances for all models developed showed no signs of overfitting. In this paper, a field-based system using unmanned aerial vehicles with the e-nose as payload was proposed and described for deployment of ML models to aid growers in pest management practices.",NA,True,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00040bdd447f041a50ae95fd51926cf435ef1eba

This technology extends the cloud by providing intermediate services at the edge of the network and improving the quality of service for latency-sensitive applications. Many AI-based solutions with machine learning, deep learning, and swarm intelligence have exhibited the high potential to perform intelligent cognitive sensing, intelligent network management, big data analytics, and security enhancement for edge-based smart applications. Despite its many benefits, there are still concerns about the required capabilities of intelligent edge computing to deal with the computational complexity of machine learning techniques for big IoT data analytics. Resource constraints of edge computing, distributed computing, efficient orchestration, and synchronization of resources are all factors that require attention for quality of service improvement and cost-effective development of edge-based smart applications. In this context, this paper aims to explore the confluence of AI and edge in many application domains in order to leverage the potential of the existing research around these factors and identify new perspectives. The confluence of edge computing and AI improves the quality of user experience in emergency situations, such as in the Internet of vehicles, where critical inaccuracies or delays can lead to damage and accidents. These are the same factors that most studies have used to evaluate the success of an edge-based application. In this review, we first provide an in-depth analysis of the state of the art of AI in edge-based applications with a focus on eight application areas: smart agriculture, smart environment, smart grid, smart healthcare, smart industry, smart education, smart transportation, and security and privacy. Then, we present a qualitative comparison that emphasizes the main objective of the confluence, the roles and the use of artificial intelligence at the network edge, and the key enabling technologies for edge analytics. Then, open challenges, future research directions, and perspectives are identified and discussed.

Previous studies have targeted particular patient populations with life-limiting disease, but few have focused on patients in a primary care setting. Toward this end, we propose a stepped-wedge pragmatic randomized trial whereby a machine learning algorithm identifies patients empaneled to primary care units at Mayo Clinic (Rochester, Minnesota, United States) with high likelihood of palliative care need. Methods 42 care team units in 9 clusters were randomized to 7 wedges, each lasting 42 days. For care teams in treatment wedges, palliative care specialists review identified patients, making recommendations to primary care providers when appropriate. Care teams in control wedges receive palliative care under the standard of care. Discussion This pragmatic trial therefore integrates machine learning into clinical decision making, instead of simply reporting theoretical predictive performance. Such integration has the possibility to decrease time to palliative care, improving patient quality of life and symptom burden.

This is especially true when these DTs are paired with real-time simulation models that make use of modern technologies like machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analytics. These combinations can provide a comprehensive and dynamic view of the monitored systems. Digital twin (DT) has shown tremendous potential to bring about revolutionary improvements in the field of construction site surveillance. There is, however, a notable paucity of empirical research identifying the constant elements affecting DT adoption in this industry. This research tries to fill that void by identifying the important elements that determine the usage of DT in construction. The study adopts a complete framework with the goal of increasing the use of DT in building site monitoring. The elements influencing the adoption and effectiveness of distributed ledger technology (DT) are divided into three categories: technological, organizational, and economic. Technological factors include the system's appropriateness and the robustness of the data infrastructure. Organizational considerations include the company's openness to innovation and leadership support. Economic aspects include things like return on investment (ROI) and cost-effectiveness. The research technique combines case studies and literature reviews to examine the benefits and drawbacks of DT in construction monitoring. This study's expected output is a comprehensive framework that aids construction businesses in optimizing the use of DT in site monitoring. This would allow for more efficient, data-driven, and forward-thinking processes. The study's ultimate purpose is to provide critical knowledge that will assist the building sector in adopting cutting-edge methods. The industry may better plan for the integration of this sophisticated technology into their operations by knowing the potential of DT and the variables driving its adoption.

The analysis of mutual trade serves as a tool for a monetary expression of economic transactions between a particular country and its foreign partners for a specific period. For the Czech Republic (CR), the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is the biggest exporter and the second biggest importer. The USA, however, imposes a number of economic sanctions against the PRC that do not have any significant impact on the trade between both countries and the overall growth of the Chinese economy, yet they affect the behavior of consumers and producers both in the USA and in the PRC.
Purpose of the article: The aim of this paper is to use machine learning for predicting the future values of the mutual trade between the CR and the PRC for one calendar year (i.e. 12 months).
Methods: Monthly data of these two states´ import and export are used to predict bilateral trade flow. The time series begins in January 2005 and ends in April 2020. Thus, the time series contains 184 data lines. Artificial intelligence - artificial neural networks - is used to predict bilateral trade flow between the PRC and the CR. The development of trade is then compared with the mutual sanctions of the PRC and the USA.
Findings & Value added: This is expected that the mutual trade balance to be negative from the perspective of the CR. COVID-19 or the sanctions imposed in the international trade will not significantly affect the development of the mutual trade between the CR and the PRC.",NA,True,['Business'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0007e9912276fe176ecca94a91fd1828059c2017

In order to improve the lifetime of wireless sensor network, three energy management approaches have been proposed. The first approach is to navigate correctly using reinforcement learning to reduce the length of the routes and to improve energy consumption. The second approach is to exploit a sleep scheduling technique to improve node energy consumption. The last approach is used to restrict data transmission of each node based on the received data change rate. Simulation results show that in terms of network lifespan, the proposed method significantly outperforms previous reported methods.",1-1,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a1779aaf160a615b268d833c30cca91f55f98

Graphs are essential in many domains, such as the description of chemical molecules, biological networks, social relationships, etc. Real-world graphs are complicated and large. As a result, there is a need to find a way to represent or encode a graph’s structure so that it can be easily utilized by machine learning models. Therefore, graph embedding is considered one of the most powerful solutions for graph representation. Inspired by the Doc2Vec model in Natural Language Processing (NLP), this paper first investigates different ways of (sub)graph embedding to represent each graph or subgraph as a fixed-length feature vector, which is then used as input to any classifier. Thus, two supervised classifiers—a deep neural network (DNN) and a convolutional neural network (CNN)—are proposed to enhance graph classification. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed models obtain competitive results and are superior to some traditional classification methods and deep-learning-based approaches on three out of five benchmark datasets, with an impressive accuracy rate of 94% on the NCI1 dataset.",NA,True,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/000a9f529fdcac451cd35d7303bcc64ea2a9fcbc

Many algorithms were developed to distinguish lncRNAs from mRNAs in transcriptomic data and facilitated discoveries of more than 600 000 of lncRNAs. However, only a tiny fraction (<1%) of lncRNA transcripts (~4000) were further validated by low-throughput experiments (EVlncRNAs). Given the cost and labor-intensive nature of experimental validations, it is necessary to develop computational tools to prioritize those potentially functional lncRNAs because many lncRNAs from high-throughput sequencing (HTlncRNAs) could be resulted from transcriptional noises. Here, we employed deep learning algorithms to separate EVlncRNAs from HTlncRNAs and mRNAs. For overcoming the challenge of small datasets, we employed a three-layer deep-learning neural network (DNN) with a K-mer feature as the input and a small convolutional neural network (CNN) with one-hot encoding as the input. Three separate models were trained for human (h), mouse (m) and plant (p), respectively. The final concatenated models (EVlncRNA-Dpred (h), EVlncRNA-Dpred (m) and EVlncRNA-Dpred (p)) provided substantial improvement over a previous model based on support-vector-machines (EVlncRNA-pred). For example, EVlncRNA-Dpred (h) achieved 0.896 for the area under receiver-operating characteristic curve, compared with 0.582 given by sequence-based EVlncRNA-pred model. The models developed here should be useful for screening lncRNA transcripts for experimental validations.

As such, it often comprises the first step towards understanding complex molecular mechanisms driving various phenotypes, spanning organ development to disease genesis, monitoring and progression. An advantage of RNA sequencing is its ability to capture complex transcriptomic events such as alternative splicing which results in alternate isoform abundance. At the same time, this advantage remains algorithmically and computationally challenging, especially with the emergence of even higher resolution technologies such as single-cell RNA sequencing. Although several algorithms have been proposed for the effective detection of differential isoform expression from RNA-Seq data, no widely accepted golden standards have been established. This fact is further compounded by the significant differences in the output of different algorithms when applied on the same data. In addition, many of the proposed algorithms remain scarce and poorly maintained. Driven by these challenges, we developed a novel integrative approach that effectively combines the most widely used algorithms for differential transcript and isoform analysis using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. We demonstrate its usability by applying it on simulated data based on several organisms, and using several performance metrics; we conclude that our strategy outperforms the application of the individual algorithms.

However, detecting zero-hour or newly designed phishing website attacks is an inherent property of machine learning and deep learning techniques. By considering a promising solution of machine learning and deep learning techniques, researchers have made a great deal of effort to tackle the this problem, which persists due to attackers constantly devising novel strategies to exploit vulnerability or gaps in existing anti-phishing measures. In this study, an extensive effort has been made to rigorously review recent studies focusing on Machine Learning and Deep Learning Based Phishing Websites Detection to excavate the root cause of the aforementioned problems and offer suitable solutions. The study followed the significant criterion to search, download, and screen relevant studies, then to evaluate criterion-based selected studies. The findings show that significant research gaps are available in the rigorously reviewed studies. These gaps are mainly related to imbalanced dataset usage, improper selection of dataset source(s), the unjustified reason for using specific train-test dataset split ratio, scientific disputes on website features inclusion and exclusion, lack of universal consensus on phishing website lifespans and on what is defining a small dataset size, and run-time analysis issues. The study clearly presented a summary of the comparative analysis performed on each reviewed research work so that future researchers could use it as a structured guideline to develop a novel solution for anti-phishing website attacks.",NA,True,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001187617ac53a0ec4ad189ceec4d8435d93fc7d

Hence, the limitations of prediction models can highly impact prioritizing maintenance tasks and allocating budget. This study aims to investigate the potential of different predictive models in reaching an effective and efficient maintenance plan. This paper reviews the literature on predictive analytics for a set of highway assets. It also highlights the gaps and limitations of the current methodologies, such as subjective assumptions and simplifications applied in deterministic and probabilistic approaches. This article additionally discusses how these shortcomings impact the application and accuracy of the methods, and how advanced predictive analytics can mitigate the challenges. In this review, we discuss how advancements in technologies coupled with ever-increasing computing power are creating opportunities for a paradigm shift in predictive analytics. We also propose new research directions including the application of advanced machine learning to develop extensible and scalable prediction models and leveraging emerging sensing technologies for collecting, storing and analyzing the data.

We propose a communication-efficient approach for distributed sparsity learning, where observations are randomly partitioned across machines.

Yet the current paradigm for perfusion MRI analysis treats all voxels or regions‐of‐interest as isolated systems supplied by a single global source. This simplification not only leads to long‐recognized systematic errors but also fails to leverage the embedded spatial structure within the data. Since the early 2000s, a variety of models and implementations have been proposed to analyze systems with between‐voxel interactions. In general, this leads to large and connected numerical inverse problems that are intractible with conventional computational methods. With recent advances in machine learning, however, these approaches are becoming practically feasible, opening up the way for a paradigm shift in the approach to perfusion MRI. This paper seeks to review the work in spatiotemporal modelling of perfusion MRI using a coherent, harmonized nomenclature and notation, with clear physical definitions and assumptions.

The outcomes of this study indicated that the rise of social media has altered the landscape of crisis communication by allowing for greater engagement. However, due to its nature, social media might also be used to spark a crisis. This means that the crisis can be both produced and disseminated through social media. Nonetheless, social media's promise as a crisis-resolution tool is undeniable. It has the capability of proving a claim, dispelling false rumors, or just demonstrating a fact. As a result, practitioners should understand how social media works and how to best use it to interact with their stakeholders.

Some serovars are host-specific or host-restricted and cause disease in distinct host species, while others, such as serovar S. Typhimurium (STm), are generalists and have the potential to colonize a wide variety of species. However, even within generalist serovars such as STm it is becoming clear that pathovariants exist that differ in tropism and virulence. Identifying the genetic factors underlying host specificity is complex, but the availability of thousands of genome sequences and advances in machine learning have made it possible to build specific host prediction models to aid outbreak control and predict the human pathogenic potential of isolates from animals and other reservoirs. We have advanced this area by building host-association prediction models trained on a wide range of genomic features and compared them with predictions based on nearest-neighbour phylogeny. SNPs, protein variants (PVs), antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles and intergenic regions (IGRs) were extracted from 3883 high-quality STm assemblies collected from humans, swine, bovine and poultry in the USA, and used to construct Random Forest (RF) machine learning models. An additional 244 recent STm assemblies from farm animals were used as a test set for further validation. The models based on PVs and IGRs had the best performance in terms of predicting the host of origin of isolates and outperformed nearest-neighbour phylogenetic host prediction as well as models based on SNPs or AMR data. However, the models did not yield reliable predictions when tested with isolates that were phylogenetically distinct from the training set. The IGR and PV models were often able to differentiate human isolates in clusters where the majority of isolates were from a single animal source. Notably, IGRs were the feature with the best performance across multiple models which may be due to IGRs acting as both a representation of their flanking genes, equivalent to PVs, while also capturing genomic regulatory variation, such as altered promoter regions. The IGR and PV models predict that ~45 % of the human infections with STm in the USA originate from bovine, ~40 % from poultry and ~14.5 % from swine, although sequences of isolates from other sources were not used for training. In summary, the research demonstrates a significant gain in accuracy for models with IGRs and PVs as features compared to SNP-based and core genome phylogeny predictions when applied within the existing population structure.

The current prognosis approaches include radiological examination and detection of serum biomarkers, however, both have limited efficiency and are ineffective in early prognosis. Due to such limitations, we propose to use RNA-Seq data for evaluating putative higher accuracy biomarkers at the transcript level that could help in early prognosis. To identify such potential transcript biomarkers, RNA-Seq data for healthy liver and various HCC cell models were subjected to five different machine learning algorithms: random forest, K-nearest neighbor, Naïve Bayes, support vector machine, and neural networks. Various metrics, namely sensitivity, specificity, MCC, informedness, and AUC-ROC (except for support vector machine) were evaluated. The algorithms that produced the highest values for all metrics were chosen to extract the top features that were subjected to recursive feature elimination. Through recursive feature elimination, the least number of features were obtained to differentiate between the healthy and HCC cell models. From the metrics used, it is demonstrated that the efficiency of the known protein biomarkers for HCC is comparatively lower than complete transcriptomics data. Among the different machine learning algorithms, random forest and support vector machine demonstrated the best performance. Using recursive feature elimination on top features of random forest and support vector machine three transcripts were selected that had an accuracy of 0.97 and kappa of 0.93. Of the three transcripts, two were protein coding (PARP2–202 and SPON2–203) and one was a non-coding transcript (CYREN-211). Lastly, we demonstrated that these three selected transcripts outperformed randomly taken three transcripts (15,000 combinations), hence were not chance findings, and could then be an interesting candidate for new HCC biomarker development. Using RNA-Seq data combined with machine learning approaches can aid in finding novel transcript biomarkers. The three biomarkers identified: PARP2–202, SPON2–203, and CYREN-211, presented the highest accuracy among all other transcripts in differentiating the healthy and HCC cell models. The machine learning pipeline developed in this study can be used for any RNA-Seq dataset to find novel transcript biomarkers.

This study investigated and analyzed particulate matter data from Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon in Jeollanam-do, with a particular focus on PM2.5. Descriptive statistics, box-and-whisker plots, correlation matrices, time variations, and trend analyses were performed for this purpose. Additionally, a prediction model for PM2.5 concentrations was developed using machine learning techniques, through which future changes in air quality were forecasted. 
Calculations were performed using R-based programs and R packages. Hourly PM2.5 data were obtained from air quality monitoring sites in Yeosu, Gwangyang, and Suncheon. After data preprocessing, the optimal prediction model was constructed using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Machine from various machine learning algorithms. 
The research results showed that there was more PM2.5 pollution in Gwangyang compared to Yeosu and Suncheon. The PM2.5 concentrations varied significantly across each monitoring site. Among the monitoring sites, the Yeosu site showed a higher correlation in PM2.5 with each other than other sites. Late winter and early spring showed higher PM2.5 concentrations, while summer and autumn showed lower concentrations. Weekly PM2.5 concentration fluctuations were not significantly different. Daily fluctuations showed an increase in PM2.5 concentrations during times of traffic congestion and a decrease in the afternoon. During the research period, the trend of PM2.5 concentration was generally decreasing. 
The accuracy of the prediction model through machine learning was over 90%, and it is expected to assist in establishing effective response strategies for future changes in air quality.

STS is an important task in natural language processing because it has many applications in different domains such as information retrieval, machine translation, plagiarism detection, document categorization, semantic search, and conversational systems. The availability of STS training and evaluation data resources for some languages such as English has led to good performance systems that achieve above 80% correlation with human judgment. Unfortunately, such required STS data resources are not available for many languages like Arabic. To overcome this challenge, this paper proposes three different approaches to generate effective STS Arabic models. The first one is based on evaluating the use of automatic machine translation for English STS data to Arabic to be used in fine-tuning. The second approach is based on the interleaving of Arabic models with English data resources. The third approach is based on fine-tuning the knowledge distillation-based models to boost their performance in Arabic using a proposed translated dataset. With very limited resources consisting of just a few hundred Arabic STS sentence pairs, we managed to achieve a score of 81% correlation, evaluated using the standard STS 2017 Arabic evaluation set. Also, we managed to extend the Arabic models to process two local dialects, Egyptian (EG) and Saudi Arabian (SA), with a correlation score of 77.5% for EG dialect and 76% for the SA dialect evaluated using dialectal conversion from the same standard STS 2017 Arabic set.",NA,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001ce6614288b92f436756e13219135d87cac363

Their unobtrusive nature and ability to provide reliable heart rate measurements facilitate the estimation of cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes, as quantified by maximum consumption of oxygen uptake. Previous studies have employed data-driven models which use heart rate information to estimate the cardiorespiratory fitness of athletes. This signifies the physiological relevance of heart rate and heart rate variability for the estimation of maximal oxygen uptake. In this work, the heart rate variability features that were extracted from both exercise and recovery segments were fed to three different Machine Learning models to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of 856 athletes performing Graded Exercise Testing. A total of 101 features from exercise and 30 features from recovery segments were given as input to three feature selection methods to avoid overfitting of the models and to obtain relevant features. This resulted in the increase of model’s accuracy by 5.7% for exercise and 4.3% for recovery. Further, post-modelling analysis was performed to remove the deviant points in two cases, initially in both training and testing and then only in training set, using k-Nearest Neighbour. In the former case, the removal of deviant points led to a reduction of 19.3% and 18.0% in overall estimation error for exercise and recovery, respectively. In the latter case, which mimicked the real-world scenario, the average R value of the models was observed to be 0.72 and 0.70 for exercise and recovery, respectively. From the above experimental approach, the utility of heart rate variability to estimate maximal oxygen uptake of large population of athletes was validated. Additionally, the proposed work contributes to the utility of cardiorespiratory fitness assessment of athletes through wearable heart rate monitors.",NA,True,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001d9b4e71b4031ecf7dd4b7bb6e32ac45102eca

Finally, the most probable transition pathway between activation states of a receptor can be identified by using the state-activity information. In addition, with this model, we can associate the contribution of each amino acid to the activation process.

According to a survey on agile software estimation, the most common cost driver among effort estimation models is software size. In-deed, previous research works proved the effectiveness of the COSMIC Functional Size Measurement (FSM) method for efficiently measuring software functional size. It has been also observed that COSMIC sizing is an efficient standardized method for measuring not only software size but also the functional size of an enhancement that may occur during the scrum enhancement project. Intending to increase the SEEE accuracy the purpose of this paper is twofold. Firstly, it attempts to construct a stacking ensemble model. Secondly, it intends to develop a localhost web application to automate the SEEE process. The constructed stacking ensemble model takes the functional Size of an enhancement or a functional change, denoted as FS(FC), as a primary independent variable. The stacking ensemble model combines three Machine Learning (ML) techniques: Decision Tree Regression, Linear Support Vector Regression, and Random Forest Regression. Results show that the use of the FS(FC) as an input to SEEE using the stacking ensemble model provides significantly better results in terms of MAE (Mean Absolute Error) = 0.206, Mean Square Error (MSE) = 0.406, and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) = 0.595.",91-100,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e3b95a7814f5547a39d63cd4727fcc288b9ec

However, multivariate mineralogical data must be transformed into lithological domains such that it is compatible with interpolation techniques and be usable for geomodeling. Manual interpretation of multivariate drill-core data is a challenging, time-consuming and subjective task, and automated or semi-automated approaches are needed. However, naive machine-learning techniques that ignore the distinct spatial structure and multi-scale nature of geological systems tend to produce geologically unreasonable results. Automated geological logging and multi-scale hierarchical domaining of drill-cores has been previously addressed in several studies by means of scalograms from a wavelet transform and tessellation, albeit exploiting only univariate information. The methodology involves the extraction of the local first principal component at a neighborhood of each observation, and the segmentation of the resulting series of scores with a continuous wavelet transform for boundary detection. In this way, the correlation pattern between the variables is incorporated into the segmentation. The scalogram accurately locates the geological boundaries at depth and yields hierarchical geological domains with mineralogical composition characteristics. The performance of this approach is demonstrated on a synthetic as well as a real multivariate dataset. The real dataset consists of mineral abundances derived from drill-core hyperspectral imaging data acquired in Elvira, a shale-hosted volcanogenic massive sulfide deposit located in the Iberian Pyrite Belt, where 7000 m of drill-core were acquired along 80 boreholes. The extracted domains are sensible from a geological point of view and spatially coherent across the boreholes in cross-sections. The results at relevant scales were qualitatively validated by comparing against the lithological log. This method is fast, is appropriate for multivariate geological data along boreholes, and provides a choice of scales for hierarchical geological domains along boreholes with mineralogical composition characteristics that can be modeled in 3D. Our approach provides an automatic way to transform hyperspectral image-derived mineral maps into vertically coherent geological units that are appropriate inputs for 3D geological modeling workflows. Moreover, the method improves the boundary detection and geological domaining by making use of multivariate information.",2676,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/001e8d27211bfbc49a09b646e6fdfdffb798d8cd

As the current track of these constructed regimes is not universally applicable, we also show major improvements in several real world low data tasks (up to +4.84 F1-score).

Research on public opinion in the field of machine learning usually focuses on micro-sentiment judgment, which is unable to offer support for the evaluation of public opinion events without additional data, and research from the perspective of artificial weighting has the disadvantage of the confusion of explanation. Judging the urgency of public opinion events is usually based on human perception, which is fuzzy and conforms to the attribute of fuzzy mathematics. Therefore, the index system in this paper was constructed in line with five principles, from which the weights were scientifically evaluated by integrating the DEMATEL and ANP model, and fuzzy mathematics was applied to determine the urgency level of public opinion. The result has three-fold significance. First, the index system constructed was more closely linked. Second, the integration of the DEMATEL and ANP weight calculating model took the interdependence of indicators fully into account.

The photochemical reflectance index (PRI) from proximal sensors and the high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery provide an opportunity to monitor the crop water status efficiently. Based on data from an experimental tomato field with intensive aerial and plant-based measurements, we developed random forest machine learning regression models to estimate tomato stem water potential (ψ stem), (using observations from proximal sensors and 12-band UAV imagery, respectively, along with weather data. The proximal sensor-based model estimation agreed well with the plant ψ stem with R 2 of 0.74 and mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.63 bars. The model included PRI, normalized difference vegetation index, vapor pressure deficit, and air temperature and tracked well with the seasonal dynamics of ψ stem across different plots. A separate model, built with multiple vegetation indices (VIs) from UAV imagery and weather variables, had an R 2 of 0.81 and MAE of 0.67 bars. The plant-level ψ stem maps generated from UAV imagery closely represented the water status differences of plots under different irrigation treatments and also tracked well the temporal change among flights. PRI was found to be the most important VI in both the proximal sensor- and the UAV-based models, providing critical information on tomato plant water status.

For this reason, the World Health Organization (WHO) has defined a washing procedure that guarantees effective and safe cleaning. This organization recommends that States promote this activity and monitor it continuously. Based on this fact, this article presents a work oriented to study the feasibility of identifying the moments in which a person carried out a hand washing, determining its beginning and duration, as well as if these washings were compliant with the WHO guidelines. The identification of washing moments is made through the analysis, by means of Machine Learning techniques, of the data that can be collected from the inertial sensors of the smartwatch the person is wearing. This study was carried out with the participation of 15 volunteers. Data was not only collected in controlled settings but, also, more than 600 hours of sensor measurements come from free-live conditions. The results of the study showed that it is feasible to build a solid solution based on the use of low cost wearables for the identification of washing moments. The solution is very effective (with F1 over 95%) with user-dependent models.

This study retrospectively investigated newly diagnosed cases of MBNs from our laboratory to investigate mutation landscapes in Chinese patients with MBNs and to combine mutational information and machine learning (ML) into clinical applications for MBNs, especially for subtype classification. Methods Samples from the Catalogue Of Somatic Mutations In Cancer (COSMIC) database were collected for ML model construction and cases from our laboratory were used for ML model validation. Five repeats of 10-fold cross-validation Random Forest algorithm was used for ML model construction. Mutation detection was performed by NGS and tumor cell size was confirmed by cell morphology and/or flow cytometry in our laboratory. Results Totally 849 newly diagnosed MBN cases from our laboratory were retrospectively identified and included in mutational landscape analyses. Patterns of gene mutations in a variety of MBN subtypes were found, important to investigate tumorigenesis in MBNs. A long list of novel mutations was revealed, valuable to both functional studies and clinical applications. By combining gene mutation information revealed by NGS and ML, we established ML models that provide valuable information for MBN subtype classification. In total, 8895 cases of 8 subtypes of MBNs in the COSMIC database were collected and utilized for ML model construction, and the models were validated on the 849 MBN cases from our laboratory. A series of ML models was constructed in this study, and the most efficient model, with an accuracy of 0.87, was based on integration of NGS testing and tumor cell sizes. Conclusions The ML models were of great significance in the differential diagnosis of all cases and different MBN subtypes.

Recent advances in deep learning and the wide use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) create opportunities to apply data-driven and predictive modeling tools for this goal.

Our contribution has two main facets. First, we describe a pioneering effort to integrate structured EHR data, neuroimaging data and clinical notes to build a multi-modal deep learning framework to predict patient’s MS severity. The proposed pipeline demonstrates up to 19% increase in terms of the area under the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) compared to models using single-modal data.

In order to run many different scenarios for the 10-year prediction, a probabilistic methodology was developed to take into account the uncertainties in this time period. The machine learning-based model provides great benefits for probabilistic simulations, due to the lower computational time, compared to process-based numerical models such as XBeach, and a flexible way in which it can incorporate measurement data. The performance of the tested machine learning models was comparable to that of the short term volume predictions of XBeach. Comparison of 10-year predicted volume changes using the machine learning model and measured beach topography (LiDAR) showed good agreement between measured and predicted volume changes for the dry beach area (when accounting for nourishments), but overestimation in the beach volume change predictions for the intertidal beach.

Despite the various advancements and the hopes of better understanding, big data management and analysis remain a challenge, calling for more rigorous and detailed research, as well as the identifications of methods and ways in which big data could be tackled and put to good use. The existing research lacks in discussing and evaluating the pertinent tools and technologies to analyze big data in an efficient manner which calls for a comprehensive and holistic analysis of the published articles to summarize the concept of big data and see field-specific applications. To address this gap and keep a recent focus, research articles published in last decade, belonging to top-tier and high-impact journals, were retrieved using the search engines of Google Scholar, Scopus, and Web of Science that were narrowed down to a set of 139 relevant research articles. Different analyses were conducted on the retrieved papers including bibliometric analysis, keywords analysis, big data search trends, and authors’ names, countries, and affiliated institutes contributing the most to the field of big data. The comparative analyses show that, conceptually, big data lies at the intersection of the storage, statistics, technology, and research fields and emerged as an amalgam of these four fields with interlinked aspects such as data hosting and computing, data management, data refining, data patterns, and machine learning. The results further show that major characteristics of big data can be summarized using the seven Vs, which include variety, volume, variability, value, visualization, veracity, and velocity. Furthermore, the existing methods for big data analysis, their shortcomings, and the possible directions were also explored that could be taken for harnessing technology to ensure data analysis tools could be upgraded to be fast and efficient. The major challenges in handling big data include efficient storage, retrieval, analysis, and visualization of the large heterogeneous data, which can be tackled through authentication such as Kerberos and encrypted files, logging of attacks, secure communication through Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), data imputation, building learning models, dividing computations into sub-tasks, checkpoint applications for recursive tasks, and using Solid State Drives (SDD) and Phase Change Material (PCM) for storage. In terms of frameworks for big data management, two frameworks exist including Hadoop and Apache Spark, which must be used simultaneously to capture the holistic essence of the data and make the analyses meaningful, swift, and speedy. Further field-specific applications of big data in two promising and integrated fields, i.e., smart real estate and disaster management, were investigated, and a framework for field-specific applications, as well as a merger of the two areas through big data, was highlighted. The proposed frameworks show that big data can tackle the ever-present issues of customer regrets related to poor quality of information or lack of information in smart real estate to increase the customer satisfaction using an intermediate organization that can process and keep a check on the data being provided to the customers by the sellers and real estate managers. Similarly, for disaster and its risk management, data from social media, drones, multimedia, and search engines can be used to tackle natural disasters such as floods, bushfires, and earthquakes, as well as plan emergency responses. In addition, a merger framework for smart real estate and disaster risk management show that big data generated from the smart real estate in the form of occupant data, facilities management, and building integration and maintenance can be shared with the disaster risk management and emergency response teams to help prevent, prepare, respond to, or recover from the disasters.",4,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0026ea8a0fd31bdc959a4b9ed4d449f3015be8d1

First, to improve data quality, we preprocessed the data via interpolation and normalization. Next, to ensure the description integrity of model input, we extracted nine time-domain features based on the statistical characteristics of sEMG signals over time. Finally, we classified the samples using XGBoost and cross-validation (CV) and compared the results to those produced by the support vector machine (SVM) and the deep neural network (DNN).

Clients who want to classify their data send them to a server that performs their inference using a trained model. The client must trust the server and provide the data in plaintext. Moreover, if the classification is done at a third-party cloud service, the model owner also needs to trust the cloud service. In this paper, we propose a protocol for privately evaluating decision trees. The protocol uses a novel private comparison function based on fully homomorphic encryption over the torus (TFHE) scheme and a programmable bootstrapping technique. Our comparison function for 32-bit and 64-bit integers is 26% faster than the naive TFHE implementation. The protocol is designed to be non-interactive and is less complex than the existing interactive protocols. Our experiment results show that our technique scales linearly with the depth of the decision tree and efficiently evaluates large decision trees on real datasets. Compared with the state of the art, ours is the only non-interactive protocol to evaluate a decision tree with high precision on encrypted parameters.

Given the ethical, practical, and regulatory challenges of employing children, young adults (18–40) can serve as suitable substitutes due to the similarity in their taste sensitivity. Taste panellists need not be experts in sensory evaluation so long as a reference product is used during evaluation; however, they should be screened for bitterness taste detection thresholds. For a more robust evaluation during the developmental phase, considerations of a scoring system and the calculation of an acceptance value may be beneficial in determining the likelihood of recommending a formulation for further development. On the technological front, artificial neural networks (ANNs) can be exploited in taste-masking optimisation of medicinal formulations as they can model complex relationships between variables and enable predictions not possible previously to optimise product profiles. Machine learning classifiers may therefore tackle the challenge of predicting the bitterness intensity of paediatric formulations. While advancements have been made, further work is needed to identify effective taste-masking techniques for specific drug molecules. Continuous refinement of machine learning algorithms, using human panellist acceptability scores, can aid in enhancing paediatric formulation development and overcoming taste-masking challenges.",NA,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028a595d2a9cfdd693befc5939764d4d087da6d

Methods A systematic search was conducted in ArrayExpress and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) cohorts from July 2005 to May 2022. Machine learning approaches, including modified Lasso penalized regression, support vector machine, and artificial neural network, were applied to identify hub ARGs, thereby developing a prediction model termed ARG classifier. Diagnostic and prognostic performance of the model was comprehensively analyzed using multi-transcriptome data. Subsequently, we systematically correlated the ARG classifier/hub ARGs with immunological characteristics of multiple aspects, including immune cell infiltration, immune and molecular pathways, cytokine levels, and immune-related genes. Further, we collected clinical specimens to preliminarily investigate ARG expression levels and to assess the diagnostic performance of ARG classifier. Results A total of ten GEO and three ArrayExpress datasets were included in this study. Based on machine learning algorithms, eight key ARGs (ATG4C, BAX, BIRC5, ERBB2, FKBP1B, HIF1A, NCKAP1, and NFKB1) were integrated to establish ARG classifier. The model exhibited excellent diagnostic values (AUC > 0.85) in multiple datasets and multiple points in time and superiorly distinguished sepsis from other critical illnesses. ARG classifier showed significant correlations with clinical characteristics or endotypes and performed better in predicting mortality (AUC = 0.70) than other clinical characteristics. Additionally, the identified hub ARGs were significantly associated with immune cell infiltration (B, T, NK, dendritic, T regulatory, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells), immune and molecular pathways (inflammation-promoting pathways, HLA, cytolytic activity, apoptosis, type-II IFN response, complement and coagulation cascades), levels of several cytokines (PDGFRB, IL-10, IFNG, and TNF), which indicated that ARG classifier/hub ARGs adequately reflected the immune microenvironment during sepsis. Finally, using clinical specimens, the expression levels of key ARGs in patients with sepsis were found to differ significantly from those of control patients, and ARG classifier exhibited superior diagnostic performance, compared to procalcitonin and C-reactive protein. Conclusion Collectively, a diagnostic and prognostic model (ARG classifier) based on eight ARGs was developed which may assist clinicians in diagnosis of sepsis and recognizing patient at high risk to guide personalized treatment. Additionally, the ARG classifier effectively reflected the immune microenvironment diversity of sepsis and may facilitate personalized counseling for specific therapy.",6165 - 6186,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0028df26e5831b753f7ae8cdafb379cbd4e78165

However, product recommendation systems mostly believe in ratings, and the purchase behavior of users instead of investigating the precious insights of users' daily activities. But we examined smartphones' GPS sensor data using machine learning algorithms to urge insights from users' daily activeness and proposed a model for predicting the product of interest of the purchasers, based on the activeness of their daily life.

This study aims to develop a new causal discovery algorithm suitable for a small number of real-world medical data using quantum computing, one of the emerging information technologies attracting attention for its application in machine learning. In this study, a new algorithm that applies the quantum kernel to a linear non-Gaussian acyclic model, one of the causal discovery algorithms, is developed. Experiments on several artificial data sets showed that the new algorithm proposed in this study was more accurate than existing methods with the Gaussian kernel under various conditions in the low-data regime. When the new algorithm was applied to real-world medical data, a case was confirmed in which the causal structure could be correctly estimated even when the amount of data was small, which was not possible with existing methods. Furthermore, the possibility of implementing the new algorithm on real quantum hardware was discussed.

We present outcome (‘recovered’, ‘isolated’ or ‘death’) risk estimates of 2019-nCoV over ‘early’ datasets. A major consideration is the likelihood of death for patients with 2019-nCoV. Method Accounting for the impact of the variations in the reporting rate of 2019-nCoV, we used machine learning techniques (AdaBoost, bagging, extra-trees, decision trees and k-nearest neighbour classifiers) on two 2019-nCoV datasets obtained from Kaggle on March 30, 2020. We used ‘country’, ‘age’ and ‘gender’ as features to predict outcome for both datasets. We included the patient’s ‘disease’ history (only present in the second dataset) to predict the outcome for the second dataset. Results The use of a patient’s ‘disease’ history improves the prediction of ‘death’ by more than sevenfold. The models ignoring a patent’s ‘disease’ history performed poorly in test predictions. Conclusion Our findings indicate the potential of using a patient’s ‘disease’ history as part of the feature set in machine learning techniques to improve 2019-nCoV predictions. This development can have a positive effect on predictive patient treatment and can result in easing currently overburdened healthcare systems worldwide, especially with the increasing prevalence of second and third wave re-infections in some countries.",NA,True,"['Medicine', 'Computer Science']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/002f8fa765093bf3df096488f409a209762b7223

By using the kernel smoothing method, we construct a squared-error consistent probability estimator for symbolic data, followed by a new data transformation model proposed to embed symbolic data into Euclidean space. Based on the model, the inner product and distance measure between symbolic data objects are reformulated, allowing a new Support Vector Machine (SVM), called SVM-S, to be defined for nonlinear classification on symbolic data using the Mercer kernel learning method.

Although different solutions have been exercised against phishing, phishing attacks have dramatically increased in the past few years. Recent studies have shown that machine learning has become prominent in the present anti-phishing context, and the techniques like deep learning have extensively improved anti-phishing tools’ detection ability. This paper proposes PhishDet, a new way of detecting phishing websites through Long-term Recurrent Convolutional Network and Graph Convolutional Network using URL and HTML features. PhishDet is the first of its kind, which uses the powerful analysis and processing capabilities of Graph Neural Network in the anti-phishing domain and recorded 96.42% detection accuracy, with a 0.036 false-negative rate. It is effective against zero-day attacks, and the average detection time which is 1.8 seconds could also be considered realistic. The feature selection of PhishDet is automatic and occurs inside the system, as PhishDet gradually learns URLs and HTML content features to handle constantly changing phishing attacks. This has outperformed similar solutions by achieving a 99.53% f1-score with a public benchmark dataset. However, PhishDet requires periodic retraining to maintain its performance over time. If such retraining could be facilitated, PhishDet could fight against phishers for a more extended period to safeguard Internet users from this Internet threat.",82355-82375,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0031e9cbc9568967755617493f525eb852baad2b

The system was composed of Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) that are commercially available, and a supervised learning algorithm which was developed for different behaviours. Three IMUs, each containing a 3-axis accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer, were attached to the dogs’ chest, back, and neck. To build and test the model, data were collected during a video-recorded behaviour test where the trainee assistance dogs performed static postures (standing, sitting, lying down) and dynamic activities (walking, body shake). Advanced feature extraction techniques were employed for the first time in this field, including statistical, temporal, and spectral methods. The most important features for posture prediction were chosen using Select K Best with ANOVA F-value. The individual contributions of each IMU, sensor, and feature type were analysed using Select K Best scores and Random Forest feature importance. Results showed that the back and chest IMUs were more important than the neck IMU, and the accelerometers were more important than the gyroscopes. The addition of IMUs to the chest and back of dog harnesses is recommended to improve performance. Additionally, statistical and temporal feature domains were more important than spectral feature domains. Three novel cascade arrangements of Random Forest and Isolation Forest were fitted to the dataset. The best classifier achieved an f1-macro of 0.83 and an f1-weighted of 0.90 for the prediction of the five postures, demonstrating a better performance than previous studies. These results were attributed to the data collection methodology (number of subjects and observations, multiple IMUs, use of common working dog breeds) and novel machine learning techniques (advanced feature extraction, feature selection and modelling arrangements) employed.

The continuous accumulation of nsSNVs resulted from the wide application of NGS has driven the development of disease-association prediction methods for decades. However, their performance on nsSNVs in IDRs remains inferior, possibly due to the domination of nsSNVs from structured regions in training data. Therefore, it is highly demanding to build a disease-association predictor specifically for nsSNVs in IDRs with better performance. Results We present IDRMutPred, a machine learning-based tool specifically for predicting disease-associated germline nsSNVs in IDRs. Based on 17 selected optimal features that are extracted from sequence alignments, protein annotations, hydrophobicity indices and disorder scores, IDRMutPred was trained using three ensemble learning algorithms on the training dataset containing only IDR nsSNVs. The evaluation on the two testing datasets shows that all the three prediction models outperform 17 other popular general predictors significantly, achieving the ACC between 0.856 and 0.868 and MCC between 0.713 and 0.737. IDRMutPred will prioritize disease-associated IDR germline nsSNVs more reliably than general predictors.

An initial exploration of the causes of privacy leaks is presented, as well as a detailed analysis of the different attacks. Finally, we present an overview of the most commonly proposed defenses and a discussion of the open problems and future directions identified during our analysis.",1 - 34,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00366d7fe89a87a13c711121637782a04edf50be

Here, we report a new development of the SAAFEC method, the SAAFEC-SEQ, which is a gradient boosting decision tree machine learning method to predict the change of the folding free energy caused by amino acid substitutions. The method does not require the 3D structure of the corresponding protein, but only its sequence and, thus, can be applied on genome-scale investigations where structural information is very sparse. SAAFEC-SEQ uses physicochemical properties, sequence features, and evolutionary information features to make the predictions. It is shown to consistently outperform all existing state-of-the-art sequence-based methods in both the Pearson correlation coefficient and root-mean-squared-error parameters as benchmarked on several independent datasets.

We used a dataset containing 5,000 movie reviews in which 2,500 were marked as positive and 2,500 as negative. We chose 5,189 words which have an influence on sentence sentiment. The dataset was prepared using a term document matrix (TDM) and classical multidimensional scaling (MDS). This is the first time that TDM and MDS have been used to choose the characteristics of text in sentiment analysis. In this case, we decided to examine different indicators of the specific classifier, such as kernel type for SVM and neighbour count in kNN.

Although formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues are deemed crucial for research and clinical applications, the fixation process results in molecular damage to nucleic acids, thus confounding their use in genome sequence analysis. Methods to improve genomic data quality from FFPE tissues have emerged, but there remains significant room for improvement. Here, we use whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from matched Fresh Frozen (FF) and FFPE tissue samples to optimize a sensitive and precise FFPE single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling approach. We present methods to reduce the prevalence of false-positive SNVs by applying combinatorial techniques to five publicly available variant callers. We also introduce FFPolish, a novel variant classification method that efficiently classifies FFPE-specific false-positive variants.

A challenge in improving treatment is resistance in genetically unstable cells. The purpose of this study is to evaluate unsupervised machine learning on classifying treatment-resistant phenotypes in heterogeneous tumors through analysis of single cell RNA sequencing(scRNAseq) data with a pipeline and evaluation metrics. scRNAseq quantifies mRNA in cells and characterizes cell phenotypes. One scRNAseq dataset was analyzed (tumor/non-tumor cells of different molecular subtypes and patient identifications). The pipeline consisted of data filtering, dimensionality reduction with Principal Component Analysis, projection with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection, clustering with nine approaches (Ward, BIRCH, Gaussian Mixture Model, DBSCAN, Spectral, Affinity Propagation, Agglomerative Clustering, Mean Shift, and K-Means), and evaluation. Seven models divided tumor versus non-tumor cells and molecular subtype while six models classified different patient identification (13 of which were presented in the dataset); K-Means, Ward, and BIRCH often ranked highest with ~80% accuracy on the tumor versus non-tumor task and ~60% for molecular subtype and patient ID. An optimized classification pipeline using K-Means, Ward, and BIRCH models was evaluated to be most effective for further analysis. In clinical research where there is currently no standard protocol for scRNAseq analysis, clusters generated from this pipeline can be used to understand cancer cell behavior and malignant growth, directly affecting the success of treatment.",NA,True,"['Computer Science', 'Biology']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00397d31e62f6cc63256c59e1553fe4f25d3580c

However, some of these algorithms are inscrutable, namely, they produce predictions that humans cannot understand or explain. This trait is in tension with the emphasis on reason‐giving in administrative law. The article explores this tension, advancing two interrelated arguments. First, providing adequate reasons is a significant facet of respecting individuals’ agency. Incorporating inscrutable algorithmic predictions into administrative decision‐making compromises this normative ideal. Second, as a long‐term concern, the use of inscrutable algorithms by administrative agencies may generate systemic effects by gradually reducing the realm of the humanly explainable in public life, a phenomenon Max Weber termed ‘re‐enchantment’. As a result, the use of inscrutable machine learning algorithms might trigger a special kind of re‐enchantment, making us comprehend less rather than more of shared human experience, and consequently altering the way we understand the administrative state and experience public life.",NA,True,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/003ac96deaefc09dee4446f9c10554fb09f6fba7

This study reports results for the real-world deployment of a smartphone app for self-directed, unsupervised assessment of balance and falls risk.

Results for a sample of 594 smartphone assessments from 147 unique phones show a strong association between self-reported falls history and the falls risk and balance impairment scores produced by the app, suggesting they may be clinically useful outcome measures.

In this context, employee attrition presents a critical problem and a big risk for organizations as it affects not only their productivity but also their planning continuity. In this context, the salient contributions of this research are as follows. Firstly, we propose a people analytics approach to predict employee attrition that shifts from a big data to a deep data context by focusing on data quality instead of its quantity. In fact, this deep data-driven approach is based on a mixed method to construct a relevant employee attrition model in order to identify key employee features influencing his/her attrition. In this method, we started thinking ‘big’ by collecting most of the common features from the literature (an exploratory research) then we tried thinking ‘deep’ by filtering and selecting the most important features using survey and feature selection algorithms (a quantitative method). Secondly, this attrition prediction approach is based on machine, deep and ensemble learning models and is experimented on a large-sized and a medium-sized simulated human resources datasets and then a real small-sized dataset from a total of 450 responses. Our approach achieves higher accuracy (0.96, 0.98 and 0.99 respectively) for the three datasets when compared previous solutions. Finally, while rewards and payments are generally considered as the most important keys to retention, our findings indicate that ‘business travel’, which is less common in the literature, is the leading motivator for employees and must be considered within HR policies to retention.",60447-60458,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0040fbc24133d560c7de163f4bd7a32e07f9fd1e

Remote monitoring frameworks for disease detection at an early stage are opposed by most conventional works. Even so, it ran into issues like increased operational complexity, higher resource costs, inaccurate predictions, longer data collection times, and a lower convergence rate. A remote health monitoring framework that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to predict heart disease and diabetes from medical datasets is the goal of this project. Patients' health data is collected via smart devices, and the resulting data is then combined using a variety of nodes, including a detection node, a visualisation node, and a prognostic node. People with long-term illnesses (such as the elderly and disabled) are in such greater demand than ever before that a new approach to healthcare delivery is essential. In the evolved paradigm, conventional physical medical services foundations like clinics, nursing homes, and long haul care offices will be old. Due to recent advancements in modern technology, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), the smart healthcare system has become increasingly necessary (ML).

Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) has been increasingly applied in the ablative treatment of thoracic tumors. This study aims to identify predictors of treatment responses in patients affected by early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or pulmonary oligo-metastases treated with SBRT and to develop an accurate machine learning model to predict radiological response to SBRT. Materials and Methods Computed tomography (CT) images of 85 tumors (stage I–II NSCLC and pulmonary oligo-metastases) from 69 patients treated with SBRT were analyzed. Gross tumor volumes (GTV) were contoured on CT images. Patients that achieved complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) were defined as responders. One hundred ten radiomic features were extracted using PyRadiomics module based on the GTV. The association of features with response to SBRT was evaluated. A model using support vector machine (SVM) was then trained to predict response based solely on the extracted radiomics features. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate model performance of the identified radiomic predictors. Results Sixty-nine patients receiving thoracic SBRT from 2008 to 2018 were retrospectively enrolled. Skewness and root mean squared were identified as radiomic predictors of response to SBRT. The SVM machine learning model developed had an accuracy of 74.8%. The area under curves for CR, PR, and non-responder prediction were 0.86 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.794–0.921), 0.946 (95% CI, 0.873–0.978), and 0.857 (95% CI, 0.789–0.915), respectively.

In general, there are two problems commonly encountered in clustering: (1) the selection of the optimal number of clusters, and (2) the undecidability of the affiliation of border data points to neighboring clusters. We address both problems and describe how to solve them in application to affective multimedia databases. In the experiment, we used the unsupervised learning algorithm k-means and the Nencki Affective Picture System (NAPS) dataset, which contains 1356 semantically and emotionally annotated pictures. The optimal number of centroids was estimated, using the empirical elbow and silhouette rules, and validated using the Monte-Carlo simulation approach. Clustering with k = 1–50 centroids is reported, along with dominant picture keywords and descriptive statistical parameters. Affective multimedia databases, such as the NAPS, have been specifically designed for emotion and attention experiments. By estimating the optimal cluster solutions, it was possible to gain deeper insight into affective features of visual stimuli.

Various sources of information can be used to this end. Starting from the sequences of two interacting protein families, one can use phylogeny or residue coevolution to infer which paralogs are specific interaction partners within each species. We show that these two signals can be combined to improve the performance of the inference of interaction partners among paralogs. For this, we first align the sequence-similarity graphs of the two families through simulated annealing, yielding a robust partial pairing. We next use this partial pairing to seed a coevolution-based iterative pairing algorithm. This combined method improves performance over either separate method. The improvement obtained is striking in the difficult cases where the average number of paralogs per species is large or where the total number of sequences is modest. Author summary When two protein families interact, their sequences feature statistical dependencies. First, interacting proteins tend to share a common evolutionary history. Second, maintaining structure and interactions through the course of evolution yields coevolution, detectable via correlations in the amino-acid usage at contacting sites. Both signals can be used to computationally predict which proteins are specific interaction partners among the paralogs of two interacting protein families, starting just from their sequences. We show that combining them improves the performance of interaction partner inference, especially when the average number of potential partners is large and when the total data set size is modest. The resulting paired multiple-sequence alignments might be used as input to machine-learning algorithms to improve protein-complex structure prediction, as well as to understand interaction specificity in signaling pathways.",NA,True,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine', 'Biology', 'Physics']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0047d0cad12b452bb9d27d81105380f589085199

Efficient microplastic monitoring is imperative to understanding the long-term effects and progression of microplastic effects in the environment. Numerical models are valuable in studying microplastic transport as they can be used to examine the effects of different parameters systematically to help elucidate the fate and transport processes of microplastics, thus providing a holistic view of microplastics in the ocean environment. By incorporating physical parameters (such as size, shape, density, and identity of microplastics), numerical models have gained better understanding of the physics of microplastic transport, predicted sinking velocities more accurately, and estimated microplastic pathways in marine environments. However, availability of large amounts of information about microplastic physical and chemical parameters is sparse. Machine learning and computer-vision tools can aid in acquiring environmental information and provide input to develop more accurate models and verify their predictions. More accurate models can further the understanding of microplastic transport, facilitate monitoring efforts, and thus optimize where more data collection can take place to ultimately improve machine learning tools. This review offers a perspective on how image-based machine learning can be exploited to help uncover the physics of microplastic transport behaviors.

With the National Institute of Health All of Us (AoU) database, we employed machine learning (ML) to predict selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-associated bleeding. Methods The AoU program, beginning in 05/2018, continues to recruit ≥ 18 years old individuals across the United States. Participants completed surveys and consented to contribute electronic health record (EHR) for research. Using the EHR, we determined participants who were exposed to SSRIs (citalopram, escitalopram, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, paroxetine, sertraline, vortioxetine). Features ( n  = 88) were selected with clinicians’ input and comprised sociodemographic, lifestyle, comorbidities, and medication use information. We identified bleeding events with validated EHR algorithms and applied logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, and extreme gradient boost to predict bleeding during SSRI exposure. We assessed model performance with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve statistic (AUC) and defined clinically significant features as resulting in > 0.01 decline in AUC after removal from the model, in three of four ML models. Results There were 10,362 participants exposed to SSRIs, with 9.6% experiencing a bleeding event during SSRI exposure. For each SSRI, performance across all four ML models was relatively consistent. AUCs from the best models ranged 0.632–0.698. Clinically significant features included health literacy for escitalopram, and bleeding history and socioeconomic status for all SSRIs. Conclusions We demonstrated feasibility of predicting ADEs using ML. Incorporating genomic features and drug interactions with deep learning models may improve ADE prediction.",NA,True,"['Medicine', 'Computer Science']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0049fa44c83d72a44e5d886c7206ac61a5cc0cad

Various machine learning-based models have showed potential as virtual quality assurance tools, being capable of accurately predicting the dose verification results of fixed-beam intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) plans, thereby ensuring safe and efficient treatment for patients. However, there has been no research yet that simultaneously integrates different IMRT techniques to predict the gamma pass rate (GPR) and explain the model.Methods: Retrospective analysis of the 3D dosimetric verification results based on measurements with gamma pass rate criteria of 3%/2 mm and 10% dose threshold of 409 pelvic IMRT and VMAT plans was carried out. Radiomics features were extracted from the dose files, from which the XGBoost algorithm based on SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values was used to select the optimal feature subset as the input for the prediction model. The study employed four different machine learning algorithms, namely, random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), to construct predictive models. Sensitivity, specificity, F1 score, and AUC value were calculated to evaluate the classification performance of these models. The SHAP values were utilized to perform a related interpretive analysis on the best performing model.Results: The sensitivities and specificities of the RF, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and LightGBM models were 0.96, 0.82, 0.93, and 0.89, and 0.38, 0.54, 0.62, and 0.62, respectively. The F1 scores and area under the curve (AUC) values were 0.86, 0.81, 0.88, and 0.86, and 0.81, 0.77, 0.85, and 0.83, respectively. The explanation of the model output based on SHAP values can provide a reference basis for medical physicists when adjusting the plan, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of treatment plans.Conclusion: It is feasible to use a machine learning method based on radiomics to establish a gamma pass rate classification prediction model for IMRT and VMAT plans in the pelvis. The XGBoost model performs better in classification than the other three tree-based ensemble models, and global explanations and single-sample explanations of the model output through SHAP values may offer reference for medical physicists to provide high-quality plans, promoting the clinical application and implementation of GPR prediction models, and providing safe and efficient personalized QA management for patients.",NA,True,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004abb09f8331e8f161049ca7578bbd3011e0f3c

In doing so, it foregrounds the boundaries and challenges of employing ML in formulating a naturalist (i.e., prima facie value-free) definition of health. The paper argues that a sweeping dataist approach cannot fully make the BST truly naturalistic, as prior theories and values persist. It also points out that supervised learning introduces circularity, rendering it incompatible with a naturalistic perspective. Additionally, it underscores the need for pre-existing auxiliary theories to assess results from unsupervised learning. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the epistemological entanglements between data and data processing methods to manage expectations about what data patterns can predict. In conclusion, the paper argues against delegating the final authority for defining complex concepts like health to AI systems, as it necessitates ethical judgment and capacities for deliberation that AI currently lacks. It also warns against granting creators and deployers of AI systems the discretionary authority to determine these definitions outside the wider social discussion, advocating for ongoing public engagement on normative notions.

We first use PSFGAN to decouple host galaxy light from the central point source, then we invoke the Galaxy Morphology Network (GaMorNet) to estimate whether the host galaxy is disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, or indeterminate. Using optical images from five bands of the HSC Wide Survey, we build models independently in three redshift bins: low (0 < z < 0.25), mid (0.25 < z < 0.5), and high (0.5 < z < 1.0). By first training on a large number of simulated galaxies, then fine-tuning using far fewer classified real galaxies, our framework predicts the actual morphology for ∼60%–70% of the host galaxies from test sets, with a classification precision of ∼80%–95%, depending on the redshift bin. Specifically, our models achieve a disk precision of 96%/82%/79% and bulge precision of 90%/90%/80% (for the three redshift bins) at thresholds corresponding to indeterminate fractions of 30%/43%/42%. The classification precision of our models has a noticeable dependency on host galaxy radius and magnitude. No strong dependency is observed on contrast ratio. Comparing classifications of real AGNs, our models agree well with traditional 2D fitting with GALFIT. The PSFGAN+GaMorNet framework does not depend on the choice of fitting functions or galaxy-related input parameters, runs orders of magnitude faster than GALFIT, and is easily generalizable via transfer learning, making it an ideal tool for studying AGN host galaxy morphology in forthcoming large imaging surveys.",NA,True,"['Physics', 'Computer Science']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004c9375fc25383cc6c0e47e28b2eba73002696d

Recent developments in image recognition technology including artificial intelligence and machine learning led to an intensified research in computer vision models. This progress also allows advances for the collection of spatio-temporal data on Invasive Alien Species (IAS), in order to understand their geographical distribution and impact on the biodiversity loss. Citizen Science (CS) approaches already show successful solutions how the public can be involved in collecting spatio-temporal data on IAS, e.g. by using mobile applications for monitoring. Our work analyzes recently developed image-based species recognition models suitable for the monitoring of IAS in CS applications. We demonstrate how computer vision models can be benchmarked for such a use case and how their accuracy can be evaluated by testing them with IAS of European Union concern. We found out that available models have different strengths. Depending on which criteria (e.g. high species coverage, costs, maintenance, high accuracies) are considered as most important, it needs to be decided individually which model fits best. Using only one model alone may not necessarily be the best solution, thus combining multiple models or developing a new custom model can be desirable. Generally, cooperation with the model providers can be advantageous.

Such models quantitatively define how a biological system works based on causal relationships and use that cumulative biological knowledge to generate predictions and recommendations (in practice) and generate/evaluate hypotheses (in research). Their limitations revolve around obtaining sufficiently accurate inputs, user training and accuracy/precision of predictions on-farm. The new wave in digitalization technologies may negate some of these challenges. New data-driven (DD) modelling methods such as machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) examine patterns in data to produce accurate predictions (forecasting, classification of animals, etc.). The deluge of sensor data and new self-learning modelling techniques may address some of the limitations of traditional MM approaches - access to input data (e.g. sensors) and on-farm calibration. However, most of these new methods lack transparency in the reasoning behind predictions, in contrast to MM that have historically been used to translate knowledge into wisdom. The objective of this paper is to propose means to hybridize these two seemingly divergent methodologies to advance the models we use in animal production systems and support movement towards truly knowledge-based precision agriculture. In order to identify potential niches for models in animal production of the future, a cross-species (dairy, swine and poultry) examination of the current state of the art in MM and new DD methodologies (ML, DL analytics) is undertaken. We hypothesize that there are several ways via which synergy may be achieved to advance both our predictive capabilities and system understanding, being: (1) building and utilizing data streams (e.g. intake, rumination behaviour, rumen sensors, activity sensors, environmental sensors, cameras and near IR) to apply MM in real-time and/or with new resolution and capabilities; (2) hybridization of MM and DD approaches where, for example, a ML framework is augmented by MM-generated parameters or predicted outcomes and (3) hybridization of the MM and DD approaches, where biological bounds are placed on parameters within a MM framework, and the DD system parameterizes the MM for individual animals, farms or other such clusters of data. As animal systems modellers, we should expand our toolbox to explore new DD approaches and big data to find opportunities to increase understanding of biological systems, find new patterns in data and move the field towards intelligent, knowledge-based precision agriculture systems.","

Indeed, by embedding secret specific markers into the model, the model owner is able to analyze the behavior of any model on these markers, called trigger instances and hence claim its ownership if this is the case. However, in the context of a Machine Learning as a Service (MLaaS) platform where models are available for inference, an attacker could forge such proofs in order to steal the ownership of these watermarked models in order to make a profit out of it. This type of attacks, called watermark forging attacks, is a serious threat against the intellectual property of models owners. Current work provides limited solutions to this problem: They constrain model owners to disclose either their models or their trigger set to a third party. In this paper, we propose counter-measures against watermark forging attacks, in a black-box environment and compatible with privacy-preserving machine learning where both the model weights and the inputs could be kept private. We show that our solution successfully prevents two different types of watermark forging attacks with minimalist assumptions regarding either the access to the model’s weight or the content of the trigger set.",295-306,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004e4647b4d1ca4d4fe97657eff7ccf256eb92f7

Longitudinal ageing surveys often lack a clinical diagnosis of dementia though measure cognition and daily function over time. We used unsupervised machine learning and longitudinal data to identify transition to probable dementia. Methods Multiple Factor Analysis was applied to longitudinal function and cognitive data of 15,278 baseline participants (aged 50 years and more) from the Survey of Health, Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (SHARE) (waves 1, 2 and 4–7, between 2004 and 2017). Hierarchical Clustering on Principal Components discriminated three clusters at each wave. We estimated probable or “Likely Dementia” prevalence by sex and age, and assessed whether dementia risk factors increased the risk of being assigned probable dementia status using multistate models. Next, we compared the “Likely Dementia” cluster with self-reported dementia status and replicated our findings in the English Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ELSA) cohort (waves 1–9, between 2002 and 2019, 7840 participants at baseline). Results Our algorithm identified a higher number of probable dementia cases compared with self-reported cases and showed good discriminative power across all waves (AUC ranged from 0.754 [0.722–0.787] to 0.830 [0.800–0.861]). “Likely Dementia” status was more prevalent in older people, displayed a 2:1 female/male ratio, and was associated with nine factors that increased risk of transition to dementia: low education, hearing loss, hypertension, drinking, smoking, depression, social isolation, physical inactivity, diabetes, and obesity.

Another major goal is improved gene selection via detection of novel groups of cross-omics biomarkers. Performance of 3Mint is assessed using different metrics. Our computational performance evaluations showed that the 3Mint classifies the BRCA molecular subtypes with lower number of genes when compared to the miRcorrNet tool which uses miRNA and mRNA gene expression profiles in terms of similar performance metrics (95% Accuracy). The incorporation of methylation data in 3Mint yields a much more focused analysis.

Setting Primary and secondary care, one participating regional centre. Participants Retrospective analysis of data from 371 799 consecutive 2WW referrals in the Leeds region from 2011 to 2019. The development cohort was composed of 224 669 consecutive patients with an urgent suspected cancer referral in Leeds between January 2011 and December 2016. The diagnostic algorithms developed were then externally validated on a similar consecutive sample of 147 130 patients (between January 2017 and December 2019). All such patients over the age of 18 with a minimum set of blood counts and biochemistry measurements available were included in the cohort. Primary and secondary outcome measures sensitivity, specificity, negative predictive value, positive predictive value, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve Area Under Curve (AUC), calibration curves Results We present results for two clinical use-cases. In use-case 1, the algorithms identify 20% of patients who do not have cancer and may not need an urgent 2WW referral. In use-case 2, they identify 90% of cancer cases with a high probability of cancer that could be prioritised for review. Conclusions Combining a panel of widely available blood markers produces effective blood tests for cancer for NHS 2WW patients. The tests are affordable, and can be deployed rapidly to any NHS pathology laboratory with no additional hardware requirements.",NA,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/004fc6090a114ac0983f270c81709b98dcd8f45b

Being detected with a telescope this light forms ""images"" of the air shower. In the TAIGA project, in addition to images obtained experimentally, model data are widely used. The difficulty is that the computational models of the underlying physical processes are very resource intensive, since they track the type, energy, position and direction of all secondary particles born in EAS. This can lead to a lack of model data for future experiments. To address this challenge, we applied a machine learning technique called Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) to quickly generate images of two types: from gamma and protons events. As a training set, we used a sample of 2D images obtained using TAIGA Monte Carlo simulation software, containing about 50,000 events. It has been experimentally established that the generation results best fit the training set in the case when for two different types of events we create two different networks and train them separately. For gamma events a discriminator with a minimum number of convolutional layers was required, while for proton events, more stable and high-quality results are obtained if two additional fully connected layers are added to the discriminator. Testing the generators of both networks using third-party software showed that more than 90% of the generated images were found to be correct. Thus, the use of GAN provides reasonably fast and accurate simulations for the TAIGA project.",NA,True,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0050941bd14c1f30d3178aa54974ba2b3dfaf1d7

Needs for datasets and a few available Pashto datasets are reviewed. Criteria of selection of data sources are discussed and three books were selected by our language specialist from the Afghan Digital Repository. The authors review previous segmentation methods and introduce a new approach to segmentation for Pashto content. The segmentation app and results are discussed to show readers how to adjust variables for different books. Our unique segmentation approach uses an expanding textbox method which performs very well given the nature of the Pashto scripts.

One way to fight antibiotic resistance is by identifying the most effective antibiotics for treating bacterial infections. This can be done through a laboratory test called AST, which is used to determine the susceptibility of bacteria to antibiotics. However, manual AST has several limitations that include time delay, limited accuracy, limited testing capacity, and subjective interpretation of results. Therefore, there is an emergent need for a more reliable and efficient alternative to manual AST. Recently, few works have tried to automate disk diffusion AST through AI-based solutions and mobile applications. However, these works do not support advanced analysis and interpretation of results, do not present evaluation of detection performance, or are not publicly available to download and use. This work proposes PalAST, a cross-platform mobile application that supports automated disk diffusion AST. The application enables biologists to take AST photos and analyze them in real time with minimal human intervention. It uses image processing and a pre-trained machine learning model to detect antibiotic disks in the agar plate and predict bounding circles for inhibition zones. Then, it provides an interpretation of results including the diameters of the inhibition zones, the labels on the antibiotic disks, and the rating of the bacteria as susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to each antibiotic. PalAST also stores the results of tests, allowing users to access and review past test results. PalAST was tested using a number of real AST photos, and the detection performance was evaluated by using common metrics, i.e. precision, recall, and Intersection over Union. We also used expert evaluation through a questionnaire to assess the usability and ease of use of PalAST.",85-99,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005255733d1ce79f3396736ceb474d4c901c4544

Based on the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network model in deep learning, combined with the vector autoregression method (VAR), this paper creatively constructs the VAR-LSTM framework and uses the predicted values of macroeconomic variables and lagged value of the time sequence as input factors to solve the problem of “parallel dislocation” of the fitting results of the traditional LSTM model which significantly improves the prediction accuracy. In order to meet the requirements of active quantitative investment for high precision prediction of stock market index, adaptive noise complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EMD) is introduced into the modeling of stock market index prediction. Combined with the efficient modeling ability of long-term and short-term memory network for medium- and long-term dependence of complex series, using the idea of “decomposition-reorganization-prediction-integration”, an integrated prediction method of stock market index CEEMDAN-LSTM is proposed. CEEMDAN is used to decompose and reconstruct the index to obtain its high and low frequency components and trend items. The LSTM prediction models of each component are constructed respectively and the IMF reorganization mode of high frequency subseries is optimized. Then the overall predicted value of the index is obtained by adding and integrating the predicted values of each component. Taking five representative stock market indexes as test data, the prediction results of CEEMDAN-LSTM and mainstream financial time series machine learning modeling methods are compared systematically. The results show that for treasury bond yield series, the prediction accuracy of ARIMA model is higher than that of general LSTM method, while VAR-LSTM model is better than ARIMA model. The prediction error in the training set and the test set is reduced by about 55% and 50% respectively, and the prediction accuracy of the change direction is improved by about 5% and 8% respectively, which has higher application value. The prediction performance of CEEMDAN-LSTM is consistently better than that of existing modeling methods, and has less prediction error and lower lag.",NA,True,['Physics'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00533958865d5c7faf1818861ef24f001812fa00

Our findings demonstrate a consistent pattern across subjects, revealing that movement velocity tends to be slower in synchrony modes. These insights support the notion that the relationship between velocity and synchrony is influenced by the cognitive load required for the task, with slower movements leading to higher synchrony in tasks demanding higher cognitive load.

Method and materials This study included 193 patients with NSCLC (154 in the training cohort, 39 in the validation cohort), 68 of whom tested positive for ALK rearrangements and 125 of whom tested negative. From the nonenhanced CT scans, 157 radiomic characteristics were extracted, and 8 clinical features were collected. Five machine learning (ML) models were assessed to find the best classification model for predicting ALK rearrangement status. A radiomic signature was developed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm. The predictive performance of the models based on radiomic features, clinical features, and their combination was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Results The support vector machine (SVM) model had the highest AUC of 0.914 for classification. The clinical features model had an AUC=0.805 (95% CI 0.731–0.877) and an AUC=0.735 (95% CI 0.566–0.863) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively.

We test the hypothesis that a trustworthy crowd of non-experts can efficiently annotate behavioral features needed for accurate machine learning detection of the common childhood developmental disorder Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) for children under 8 years old. We implement a novel process for identifying and certifying a trustworthy distributed workforce for video feature extraction, selecting a workforce of 102 workers from a pool of 1,107. Two previously validated ASD logistic regression classifiers, evaluated against parent-reported diagnoses, were used to assess the accuracy of the trusted crowd’s ratings of unstructured home videos. A representative balanced sample (N = 50 videos) of videos were evaluated with and without face box and pitch shift privacy alterations, with AUROC and AUPRC scores > 0.98. With both privacy-preserving modifications, sensitivity is preserved (96.0%) while maintaining specificity (80.0%) and accuracy (88.0%) at levels comparable to prior classification methods without alterations. We find that machine learning classification from features extracted by a certified nonexpert crowd achieves high performance for ASD detection from natural home videos of the child at risk and maintains high sensitivity when privacy-preserving mechanisms are applied. These results suggest that privacy-safeguarded crowdsourced analysis of short home videos can help enable rapid and mobile machine-learning detection of developmental delays in children.",NA,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0056d7900756c20194511e9c61cdedacf8d13084

Here, we present a new approach to predict time series data combining interpolation techniques, randomly parameterized LSTM neural networks and measures of signal complexity, which we will refer to as complexity measures throughout this research. First, we interpolate the time series data under study. Next, we predict the time series data using an ensemble of randomly parameterized LSTM neural networks. Finally, we filter the ensemble prediction based on the original data complexity to improve the predictability, i.e., we keep only predictions with a complexity close to that of the training data. We test the proposed approach on five different univariate time series data. We use linear and fractal interpolation to increase the amount of data. We tested five different complexity measures for the ensemble filters for time series data, i.e., the Hurst exponent, Shannon’s entropy, Fisher’s information, SVD entropy, and the spectrum of Lyapunov exponents. Our results show that the interpolated predictions consistently outperformed the non-interpolated ones. The best ensemble predictions always beat a baseline prediction based on a neural network with only a single hidden LSTM, gated recurrent unit (GRU) or simple recurrent neural network (RNN) layer. The complexity filters can reduce the error of a random ensemble prediction by a factor of 10. Further, because we use randomly parameterized neural networks, no hyperparameter tuning is required.

Their main benefits include adaptability, configuration,and flexibility, with added efficiency in cost and transmission time. Traffic prediction refers to forecasting the traffic volumes in a network. The traffic volume includes incoming requests and outgoing data transmitted by the network nodes. The previous logs of traffic in the network are used for extracting patterns that help for accurate predictions. In this paper, an analysis of various existing traffic prediction methods is done. Specifically, the analysis of a case study where the performance of the High-Speed Diesel (HSD) pump is predicted by observing its output. A network of sensors forms a less mesh network, sensors act as nodes while reading the parameters namely, three phase Current, Voltage, Temperature, and Vibration. In this case study, a High-Speed Diesel pumps’ performance is predicted by predicting the vibration parameter as the output parameter. Other parameters affecting the performance of the High-Speed Diesel pump which are causing the change in vibration value are identified. Various algorithms including Statistical Auto-Regressive Integration and Moving Average, Poisson’s regression, and few Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms like Decision Tree Regressor,Multi Layer Perceptron, Linear Regression, and Long Short-Term Memory are implemented and evaluated for this purpose. Along with the comparison, a novel architecture using Convolution Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory is described in this paper. The result and comparison between these give the clear understanding that the suggested novel Convo-LSTM model gives better performance and helps to predict the performance of the High-Speed Diesel pump.

However, it is a challenge to accurately real-time sense the complex running states of the rail vehicle on an Internet-of-Things (IoT) edge device. Traditional systems usually upload a large amount of real-time data from the vehicle to the cloud for identification, which is laborious and inefficient. In this paper, an intelligent identification method for rail vehicle running state is proposed based on Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) technology, and an IoT system is developed with small size and low energy consumption. The system uses a Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) sensor to collect acceleration data for machine learning training. A neural network model for recognizing the running state of rail vehicles is built and trained by defining a machine learning running state classification model. The trained recognition model is deployed to the IoT edge device at the vehicle side, and an offset time window method is utilized for real-time state sensing. In addition, the sensing results are uploaded to the IoT server for visualization. The experiments on the subway vehicle showed that the system could identify six complex running states in real-time with over 99% accuracy using only one IoT microcontroller. The model with three axes converges faster than the model with one. The model recognition accuracy remained above 98% and 95%, under different installation positions on the rail vehicle and the zero-drift phenomenon of the MEMS acceleration sensor, respectively.

However, subtle changes during MCI make it challenging to classify in machine learning. The previous pathological analysis pointed out that the hippocampus is the critical hub for the white matter (WM) network of MCI. Damage to the white matter pathways around the hippocampus is the main cause of memory decline in MCI. Therefore, it is vital to biologically extract features from the WM network driven by hippocampus-related regions to improve classification performance. Methods Our study proposes a method for feature extraction of the whole-brain WM network. First, 42 MCI and 54 normal control (NC) subjects were recruited using diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI), and T1-weighted (T1w) imaging. Second, mean diffusivity (MD) and fractional anisotropy (FA) were calculated from DTI, and the whole-brain WM networks were obtained. Third, regions of interest (ROIs) with significant functional connectivity to the hippocampus were selected for feature extraction, and the hippocampus (HIP)-related WM networks were obtained. Furthermore, the rank sum test with Bonferroni correction was used to retain significantly different connectivity between MCI and NC, and significant HIP-related WM networks were obtained. Finally, the classification performances of these three WM networks were compared to select the optimal feature and classifier. Results (1) For the features, the whole-brain WM network, HIP-related WM network, and significant HIP-related WM network are significantly improved in turn. Also, the accuracy of MD networks as features is better than FA. (2) For the classification algorithm, the support vector machine (SVM) classifier with radial basis function, taking the significant HIP-related WM network in MD as a feature, has the optimal classification performance (accuracy = 89.4%, AUC = 0.954). (3) For the pathologic mechanism, the hippocampus and thalamus are crucial hubs of the WM network for MCI.

Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop a multiple-level stacked ensemble machine learning framework for improving the estimation of the daily ground-level PM2.5 concentrations. Methods: An innovative deep ensemble machine learning framework (DEML) was developed to estimate the daily PM2.5 concentrations. The framework has a three-stage structure: At the first stage, four base models [gradient boosting machine (GBM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)] were used to generate a new data set of PM2.5 concentrations for training the next-stage learners. At the second stage, three meta-models [RF, XGBoost, and Generalized Linear Model (GLM)] were used to estimate PM2.5 concentrations using a combination of the original data set and the predictions from the first-stage models. At the third stage, a nonnegative least squares (NNLS) algorithm was employed to obtain the optimal weights for PM2.5 estimation. We took the data from 133 monitoring stations in Italy as an example to implement the DEML to predict daily PM2.5 at each 1km×1km grid cell from 2015 to 2019 across Italy. We evaluated the model performance by performing 10-fold cross-validation (CV) and compared it with five benchmark algorithms [GBM, SVM, RF, XGBoost, and Super Learner (SL)]. Results: The results revealed that the PM2.5 prediction performance of DEML [coefficients of determination (R2)=0.87 and root mean square error (RMSE)=5.38μg/m3] was superior to any benchmark models (with R2 of 0.51, 0.76, 0.83, 0.70, and 0.83 for GBM, SVM, RF, XGBoost, and SL approach, respectively). DEML displayed reliable performance in capturing the spatiotemporal variations of PM2.5 in Italy. Discussion: The proposed DEML framework achieved an outstanding performance in PM2.5 estimation, which could be used as a tool for more accurate environmental exposure assessment. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP9752",NA,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/005cc5c91cc73c1197268f27344b70ef2a920a77

PopGenAdapt is designed to leverage the substantial labeled data available from individuals of European ancestry, as well as the limited labeled and the larger amount of unlabeled data from currently underrepresented populations. The method is evaluated in underrepresented populations from Nigeria, Sri Lanka, and Hawaii for the prediction of several disease outcomes. The results suggest a significant improvement in the performance of genotype-to-phenotype models for these populations over state-of-the-art supervised learning methods, setting SSDA as a promising strategy for creating more inclusive machine learning models in biomedical research.

Signature-based misuse detection, hybrid detection, and anomaly detection, while effective in isolation, often struggle to keep pace with the ever-evolving tactics employed by attackers. This research stems from the pressing need to develop intrusion detection models that offer improved accuracy, adaptability, and robustness in the face of rapidly changing attack vectors. Our study leverages a comprehensive set of experiments conducted on diverse datasets, including N-BaIoT, NSL-KDD, and CICIDS2017. The primary focus is on the evaluation and comparison of machine learning algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and decision trees. Notably, our research culminates in the development of a hybrid intrusion detection model that combines the strengths of these algorithms. The results of our experiments indicate that the hybrid model, particularly when combining Random Forest and XGBoost, exhibits exceptional accuracy. This approach outperforms individual algorithms, achieving an accuracy rate of 97% in certain cases. We attribute this success to the ensemble learning approach, which capitalizes on the consensus of diverse classifiers. In conclusion, our research not only demonstrates the effectiveness of ensemble learning in enhancing intrusion detection but also underscores the importance of continuous adaptation in the face of evolving threats.

An incremental support vector machine (SVM) is adopted for authentication implementing incremental learning. We collected ECG signals from 11 subjects during 10 min over six days and used the data from days 1 to 5 for incremental learning, and those from day 6 for testing. The authentication results show that the proposed system consistently reduces the false acceptance rate from 6.49% to 4.39% and increases the true acceptance rate from 61.32% to 87.61% per single ECG wave after incremental learning using data from the five days.

Researchers around the world have developed ways to automate the diagnosis of dementia through the use of machine learning and data mining approaches. The aim of this research project is to design and develop a day-to-day activity prediction algorithm in order to accurately identify and differentiate the dementia affected patients from the healthy subjects, to ensure early diagnosis of dementia development. This research advocates a novel algorithm called ‘Sequence Prediction via All Discoverable Episodes (SPADE)’ as a statistical tool to map activities of daily life (ADLs) in different groups of people in order to develop a unique parameter for precise diagnosis. The results of our experiment demonstrated a significant difference (i.e. 11 %) in the sequence prediction peak accuracy between the healthy subjects and the residents with dementia. SPADE demonstrated an adequate accuracy (i.e. 80 % on average), with an improvement of about 12 % compared to the performance of M-SPEED in inferring future occurrences of activities.

Resting rate pressure product (rRPP) varies from one individual to the next, but its biochemical/cellular phenotype remains unknown. This study determined the degree to which an individual's biochemical/cellular profile as characterized by a standard blood panel is predictive of rRPP, as well the importance of each blood biomarker in this prediction. Methods We included data from 55,730 participants in this study with complete rRPP measurements and concurrently collected blood panel information from the Health Management Centre at the Affiliated Hospital of Hangzhou Normal University. We used the XGBoost machine learning algorithm to train a tree-based model and then assessed its accuracy on an independent portion of the dataset and then compared its performance against a standard linear regression technique. We further determined the predictive importance of each feature in the blood panel. Results We found a fair positive correlation (Pearson r) of 0.377 (95% CI: 0.375-0.378) between observed rRPP and rRPP predicted from blood biomarkers. By comparison, the performance for standard linear regression was 0.352 (95% CI: 0.351-0.354). The top three predictors in this model were glucose concentration, total protein concentration, and neutrophil count.

However, the large amounts of data required for unsupervised learning mean that these traditional approaches encounter problems where data is sparse. In addition, these models are often used with insufficient regard for the details of the underlying optimization process. This poses a problem in engineering where the ability to explain model predictions (explainability) is often a prerequisite. There is a particular issue where ML methods may reach a conclusion which does not agree with existing physical understanding. Further, for problems where some of the underlying physics is already known, the traditional ML approach is effectively using large data sets to “re-learn” existing physical understanding. A potential solution to these issues is the incorporation of physical domain knowledge into the model or its training process to produce Informed Machine Learning. This paper provides an overview of the current state of informed machine learning for application in engineering. Firstly, the definition of explainable machine learning is explored. A selection of methods that incorporate physical priories into the machine learning pipeline is then described, leading to a review of current applications of informed machine learning in engineering.

The model is divided into three phases: creating a dataset, creating a neural network based on the dataset, and retraining the neural network to handle unpredictable inputs. The model utilizes entropy values and a non-dominant sorting algorithm to identify the candidate with the highest entropy value from the dataset. This is followed by merging the training set with adversarial samples, where a mini-batch of the merged dataset is used to update the dense network parameters. This method can improve the performance of machine learning models, categorization of radiographic images, risk of misdiagnosis in medical imaging, and accuracy of medical diagnoses. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed model, two datasets, MNIST and COVID, were used with pixel values and without transfer learning. The results showed an increase of accuracy from 0.85 to 0.88 for MNIST and from 0.83 to 0.85 for COVID, which suggests that the model successfully classified images from both datasets without using transfer learning techniques.",11355 - 11386,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0068951933767006cce00c86cdc1a4a836d162f1

It is a fundamental characteristic that links hydrologic transport, biogeochemical processing, and water quality, and it has broad implications for resource vulnerability and sustainability. Physically based models can accurately describe transit time distributions but require significant computational resources when applied to large regions at high resolutions. In this study, we evaluate the potential of machine learning metamodels to emulate physically based models for computationally efficient prediction of key metrics from transit time distributions. Transit times are computed from a continental scale, integrated hydrologic model coupled with particle tracking. The metamodeling approach is illustrated in the 280,000-sq km Upper Colorado River Basin, USA, a principal headwater basin that is under multiple stresses, including resource overallocation, water quality threats, and climate change impacts. We evaluate the effects of using different types of spatial aggregation in the metamodels, including regular grids, hydrologic units, and upstream watersheds. We found that metamodels using upstream watershed aggregation exhibited the best overall performance across our target predictions. Errors were more pronounced in metamodels that employed smaller spatial aggregation units compared to larger units, suggesting that additional predictors that capture the heterogeneity of topographic, climatic, and geologic properties are needed at these scales. We also found that predictor importance and input-output relations were remarkably consistent across spatial aggregation type and agree with previous findings documented from physically based models and tracer-based studies. Our results show the feasibility of developing machine learning metamodels for predicting transit times and demonstrate the necessity of multiscale analyses to probe the robustness of the findings.",NA,True,['Physics'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006b93c1b484ec6625d466a65f6950d2c68370b5

Because of the internet, the people in the current society has too many options that’s why the recommendation system is very essential. The recommendation is achieved by the particular users who predict the ratings for numerous items and recommend those items to other users. Majorly, content and collaborative filtering techniques are employed in typical recommendation systems to find user preferences and provide final recommendations. But, these systems commonly lacks to take growing user preferences in various contextual factors. Context aware recommendation systems consider various contextual parameters into account and attempt to catch user preferences appropriately. The majority of the work in the recommender system domain focuses on increasing the recommendation accuracy by employing several proposed approaches where the main motive remains to maximize the accuracy of recommendations while ignoring other design objectives, such as a user’s an item’s context. Therefore, in this paper an effective deep learning based context aware recommendation model is proposed which can be act as an efficient recommender system by showing minimum error during recommendation. Initially, the dataset is pre-processed using Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) in Python platform. After pre-processing, the TF–IDF and word embedding model is used for every pre-processed reviews to extract the features and contextual information. The extracted feature is considered as an input of density based clustering to group the negative, neutral and positive sentiments of user reviews. Finally, deep recurrent neural Network (DRNN) is employed to get the most preferable user from every cluster. The recurrent neural network model parameter values are initialized through the fitness computation of Bald Eagle Search (BES) algorithm. The proposed model is implemented using NYC Restaurant Rich Dataset using Python programming platform and performance is evaluated based on the metrics of accuracy, precision, recall and compared with existing models.

Therefore, it is crucial to identify the novel subgroups of patients with similar molecular characteristics. It is possible to propose a better treatment strategy when the heterogeneity of the patient is accounted for during subgroup identification, irrespective of the tissue of origin. This work proposes a machine learning (ML) based pipeline for subgroup identification in pan-cancer. Here, mRNA, miRNA, DNA methylation, and protein expression features from pan-cancer samples were concatenated and non-linearly projected to a lower dimension using an ML algorithm. This data was then clustered to identify multi-omics-based novel subgroups. The clinical characterization of these ML subgroups indicated significant differences in overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) (p-value<0.0001). The subgroups formed by the patients from different tumors shared similar molecular alterations in terms of immune microenvironment, mutation profile, and enriched pathways. Further, decision-level and feature-level fused classification models were built to identify the novel subgroups for unseen samples. Additionally, the classification models were used to obtain the class labels for the validation samples, and the molecular characteristics were verified. To summarize, this work identified novel ML subgroups using multi-omics data and showed that the patients with different tumor types could be similar molecularly. We also proposed and validated the classification models for subgroup identification. The proposed classification models can be used to identify the novel multi-omics subgroups, and the molecular characteristics of each subgroup can be used to design appropriate treatment regimen.",NA,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/006ec1c908983173d2615652afc575dedae2c132

Having too few available interaction records brings a series of challenges when predicting user preferences. At present, there are two main kinds of strategies for solving this problem from different perspectives. One is cross-domain recommendation (CDR), which introduces additional information by domain knowledge propagation with transfer learning. However, CDR methods follow traditional training processes in machine learning and cannot solve this typical few-shot problem from the perspective of optimization. The other type of methods that has recently emerged is based on meta-learning. Most of these approaches focus only on generating a meta-model to perform better on new tasks and ignore improvements based on cross-domain information. Therefore, it is necessary to design a novel approach to solve this problem with both domain knowledge and meta-optimization. To achieve this goal, a novel cross-domain meta-learner for cold-start recommendation (MetaCDR) is proposed. In MetaCDR, we design a domain knowledge meta-transfer module to connect different domain networks. In addition, we introduce a pretraining strategy to ensure its efficiency.

In recent years, machine learning has offered a renaissance to the fluid community due to the rapid developments in data science, processing units, neural network based technologies, and sensor adaptations. So far in many applications in fluid dynamics, machine learning approaches have been mostly focused on a standard process that requires centralizing the training data on a designated machine or in a data center. In this article, we present a federated machine learning approach that enables localized clients to collaboratively learn an aggregated and shared predictive model while keeping all the training data on each edge device. We demonstrate the feasibility and prospects of such a decentralized learning approach with an effort to forge a deep learning surrogate model for reconstructing spatiotemporal fields.

This paper creates a complete and publicly available set of microestimates of the distribution of relative poverty and wealth across all 135 low- and middle-income countries. We provide extensive evidence of the accuracy and validity of the estimates and also provide confidence intervals for each microestimate to facilitate responsible downstream use. These methods and maps provide a set of tools to study economic development and growth, guide interventions, monitor and evaluate policies, and track the elimination of poverty worldwide. Many critical policy decisions, from strategic investments to the allocation of humanitarian aid, rely on data about the geographic distribution of wealth and poverty. Yet many poverty maps are out of date or exist only at very coarse levels of granularity. Here we develop microestimates of the relative wealth and poverty of the populated surface of all 135 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) at 2.4 km resolution. The estimates are built by applying machine-learning algorithms to vast and heterogeneous data from satellites, mobile phone networks, and topographic maps, as well as aggregated and deidentified connectivity data from Facebook. We train and calibrate the estimates using nationally representative household survey data from 56 LMICs and then validate their accuracy using four independent sources of household survey data from 18 countries. We also provide confidence intervals for each microestimate to facilitate responsible downstream use.

It shifts control logic from the devices to a centralized entity (programmable controller) for efficient traffic monitoring and flow management. A software-based controller enforces rules and policies on the requests sent by forwarding elements; however, it cannot detect anomalous patterns in the network traffic. Due to this, the controller may install the flow rules against the anomalies, reducing the overall network performance. These anomalies may indicate threats to the network and decrease its performance and security. Machine learning (ML) approaches can identify such traffic flow patterns and predict the systems’ impending threats. We propose an ML-based service to predict traffic anomalies for software-defined networks in this work. We first create a large dataset for network traffic by modeling a programmable data center with a signature-based intrusion-detection system. The feature vectors are pre-processed and are constructed against each flow request by the forwarding element. Then, we input the feature vector of each request to a machine learning classifier for training to predict anomalies. Finally, we use the holdout cross-validation technique to evaluate the proposed approach. The evaluation results specify that the proposed approach is highly accurate.

In practice, only approximate techniques have been considered so far. Currently, the most popular method is the bit-flipping technique, where the L1-norm maximization is viewed as a combinatorial problem over the binary field. Recently, we proposed exhaustive, but faster algorithm [1] based on two-dimensional Jacobi rotations that also offer high accuracy. In this paper, we develop a novel variant of this method that uses three-dimensional rotations and quaternion algebra.

The primary objective of this study was to develop a robust predictive model for grapevine nitrogen estimation at bloom stage using high-resolution multispectral images captured by an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). Aerial imagery and leaf tissue sampling were conducted from 150 grapevines subjected to five rates of nitrogen applications. Subsequent to appropriate pre-processing steps, pixels representing the canopy were segmented from the background per each vine. First, we defined a binary classification problem using pixels of three vines with the minimum (low-N class) and two vines with the maximum (high-N class) nitrogen concentration. Following optimized hyperparameters configuration, we trained five machine learning classifiers, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest, XGBoost, quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA), and deep neural network (DNN) with fully-connected layers. Among the classifiers, SVM offered the highest F1-score (82.24%) on the test dataset at the cost of a very long training time compared to the other classifiers. Alternatively, QDA and XGBoost required the minimum training time with promising F1-score of 80.85% and 80.27%, respectively. Second, we transformed the classification into a regression problem by averaging the posterior probability of high-N class for all pixels within each of 150 vines. XGBoost exhibited a slightly larger coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.56) and lower root mean square error (RMSE) (0.23%) compared to other learning methods in the prediction of nitrogen concentration of all vines.

The approximate computing technique is the key to lowering hardware complexity and improving energy efficiency and performance. However, it is a challenge to properly design approximate multipliers since input data are unseen to users. This challenge can be overcome by Machine Learning (ML) classifiers. ML classifiers can predict the detailed feature of upcoming input data. Previous approximate multipliers are designed using simple adders based on ML classifiers but by using a simple adder-based approximate multiplier, the level of approximation cannot change at runtime. To overcome this drawback, using an accumulator and reconfigurable adders instead of simple adders are proposed in this paper. Also, the rounding technique is applied to approximate floating-point multipliers for further improvement. Our experimental results show that when the error tolerance of our target application is less than 5%, the proposed approximate multiplier can save area by 70.98%, and when the error tolerance is less than 3%, a rounding enhanced simple adders-based approximate multiplier can save area by 65.9% and a reconfigurable adder-based approximate multiplier with rounding can reduce the average delay and energy by 54.95% and 46.67% respectively compared to an exact multiplier.",117-118,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/007b1f330e492b17f8f47843d74cd327250c4a0c

Increasingly stricter rules on pollutant emissions and greater awareness of air quality by consumers are pushing the transport sector towards sustainable mobility. In this historical context, electric cars have been considered the most valid alternative to traditional internal combustion engine cars, thanks to their low polluting potential, with high growth prospects in the coming years. This growth is an important element for companies operating in the electricity sector, since the spread of electric cars is necessarily accompanied by an increasing need of electric charging points, which may impact the electricity distribution network. In this work we proposed a novel application of machine learning methods for the estimation of factors which could impact the distribution of the circulating fleet of electric cars in Italy. We first collected a new dataset from public repository to evaluate the most relevant features impacting the electric cars market. The collected datasets are completely new, and were collected starting from the identification of the main variables that were potentially responsible for the spread of electric cars. Subsequently we distributed a novel designed survey to further investigate such factors on a population sample. Using machine learning models, we could disentangle potentially new interesting information concerning the Italian scenario. We analysed it, in fact, according to different geographical Italian dimensions (national, regional and provincial) and with the final identification of those potential factors that could play a fundamental role in the success and distribution of electric cars mobility.

Our research results show five profiles of entrepreneurs, mainly differentiated by age and entrepreneurial motives, as well as the identification of relevant skills, capacities, and capabilities for entrepreneurship, such as creativity, learning, and leadership. The sample consists of 633 young people aged between 14 and 28 years in Medellín. The data treatment was approached through cluster analysis using the K-means algorithm to obtain information about the underlying nature and structure of the data. These data analysis techniques provide valuable information that can help to better understand the behaviour of Colombian entrepreneurs. They also reveal hidden information in the data. Therefore, one of the advantages of using statistical and artificial intelligence techniques in this type of study is to extract valuable information that might otherwise go unnoticed. The clusters generated show correlations with profiles that can support the design of policies in Colombia to promote an entrepreneurial ecosystem and the creation and development of new businesses through business regulation.",NA,True,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/007d6e6be042e11559022f7a4141a7bb8701f5a1

The ability to predict VOCs would allow a timely and adequate intervention. The first step towards this ultimate goal is to use patient-friendly and accessible technology to collect relevant data that helps infer a patient's pain experience during VOC. This study aims to: (1) determine the feasibility of remotely monitoring with a consumer wearable during hospitalization for VOC and up to 30 days after discharge, and (2) evaluate the accuracy of pain prediction using machine learning models based on physiological parameters measured by a consumer wearable. Methods Patients with SCD (≥18 years) who were admitted for a vaso-occlusive crisis were enrolled at a single academic center. Participants were instructed to report daily pain scores (0–10) in a mobile app (Nanbar) and to continuously wear an Apple Watch up to 30 days after discharge. Data included heart rate (in rest, average and variability) and step count. Demographics, SCD genotype, and details of hospitalization including pain scores reported to nurses, were extracted from electronic medical records. Physiological data from the wearable were associated with pain scores to fit 3 different machine learning classification models. The performance of the machine learning models was evaluated using: accuracy, F1, root-mean-square error and area under the receiver-operating curve. Results Between April and June 2022, 19 patients (74% HbSS genotype) were included in this study and followed for a median time of 28 days [IQR 22–34], yielding a dataset of 2,395 pain data points. Ten participants were enrolled while hospitalized for VOC. The metrics of the best performing model, the random forest model, were micro-averaged accuracy of 92%, micro-averaged F1-score of 0.63, root-mean-square error of 1.1, and area under the receiving operating characteristic curve of 0.9. Conclusion Our random forest model accurately predicts high pain scores during admission for VOC and after discharge. The Apple Watch was a feasible method to collect physiologic data and provided accuracy in prediction of pain scores.",NA,True,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/007fe6b94d33270242cddb9475fbc6dbc3724904

With the rapid development of wireless sensor network technology and wireless sensor network applications, the wireless sensor network data traffic also grows rapidly, and various kinds of viruses and attacks appear. Based on the temporal correlation characteristics of the intrusion detection dataset, we propose a multicorrelation-based intrusion detection model for long- and short-term memory wireless sensor networks. The model selects the optimal feature subset through the information gain feature selection module, converts the feature subset into a TAM matrix using the multicorrelation analysis algorithm, and inputs the TAM matrix into the long- and short-term memory wireless sensor network module for training and testing. Aiming at the problems of low detection accuracy and high false alarm rate of traditional machine learning-based wireless sensor network intrusion detection models in the intrusion detection process, a wireless sensor network intrusion detection model combining two-way long- and short-term memory wireless sensor network and C5.0 classifier is proposed. The model first uses the hidden layer of the bidirectional long- and short-term memory wireless sensor network to extract the features of the intrusion detection data set and finally inputs extracted features into the C5.0 classifier for training and classification. In order to illustrate the applicability of the model, the experiment selects three different data sets as the experimental data sets and conducts simulation performance analysis through simulation experiments.

Its goal is to develop a set of tools—pairing AI with human judgment—to help ministries of health and related health institutions respond to infodemics. Public health officials will learn about emerging threats detected by the center and get recommendations on how to respond. The virtual center is structured with three parallel teams: detection, evidence, and response. The detection team will employ a mixture of advanced search queries, machine learning, and other AI techniques to sift through more than 800 million new public social media posts per day to identify emerging infodemic threats in both English and Spanish. The evidence team will use the EasySearch federated search engine backed by AI, PAHO’s knowledge management team, and the Librarian Reserve Corps to identify the most relevant authoritative sources.

Moreover, it has gradually become the most widely used computational approach in the field of ML, thus achieving outstanding results on several complex cognitive tasks, matching or even beating those provided by human performance. One of the benefits of DL is the ability to learn massive amounts of data. The DL field has grown fast in the last few years and it has been extensively used to successfully address a wide range of traditional applications. More importantly, DL has outperformed well-known ML techniques in many domains, e.g., cybersecurity, natural language processing, bioinformatics, robotics and control, and medical information processing, among many others. Despite it has been contributed several works reviewing the State-of-the-Art on DL, all of them only tackled one aspect of the DL, which leads to an overall lack of knowledge about it. Therefore, in this contribution, we propose using a more holistic approach in order to provide a more suitable starting point from which to develop a full understanding of DL. Specifically, this review attempts to provide a more comprehensive survey of the most important aspects of DL and including those enhancements recently added to the field. In particular, this paper outlines the importance of DL, presents the types of DL techniques and networks. It then presents convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which the most utilized DL network type and describes the development of CNNs architectures together with their main features, e.g., starting with the AlexNet network and closing with the High-Resolution network (HR.Net). Finally, we further present the challenges and suggested solutions to help researchers understand the existing research gaps. It is followed by a list of the major DL applications.

However, existing inverse design approaches are yet matured to capture the full desired behaviors due to challenges stemmed from multiple design objectives, nonlinear behavior, and process-dependent manufacturing errors. Here, we report a rapid inverse design methodology, leveraging generative machine learning and desktop additive manufacturing, which enables the creation of nearly all possible uniaxial compressive stress‒strain curve cases while accounting for process-dependent errors from printing. Results show that mechanical behavior with full tailorability can be achieved with nearly 90% fidelity between target and experimentally measured results.

So, approaches that uses artificial intelligence techniques to help the experts to help them turning explicit their expert knowledge and analysing the cases is very important. Analysing cementation quality in oil wells is one of these cases. Primary cementation operation of an oil well is creating a hydraulic seal in the annular space formed between the coating pipe and the open well wall, preventing the flow between different geological zones bearing water or hydrocarbons. To evaluate the quality of this seal at determined depths, acoustic tools are used, aiming to collect sonic and ultrasonic signals. Verifying the quality of the available data for cementation quality evaluation is a task that consumes time and effort of the domain experts, mainly due to data dispersion in different data sources and missing labels in data.

Particularly, in educational institutions, ML and DL algorithms can help instructors in predicting the learning performance of learners. Furthermore, the prediction of the learning performance of learners can assist instructors and intelligent learning systems (ILSs) in taking preemptive measures (i.e., early engagement or early intervention measures) so that the learning performance of weak learners could be increased thus reducing learners’ failures and dropout rates. In this study, we propose an intelligent learning system (ILS) powered by the mobile learning (M-learning) model that predicts learners’ performance and classify them into various performance groups. Subsequently, adaptive feedback and support are provided to those learners who struggle in their studies. Four M-learning models were created for different learners considering their learning features (study behavior) and their weight values. The M-learning model was based on the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm with the aim to predict learners’ performance and classify them into five performance groups, whereas the random forest (RF) algorithm was used to determine each feature’s importance in the creation of the M-learning model. In the last stage of this study, we performed an early intervention/engagement experiment on those learners who showed weak performance in their study.

Currently, the difference in the correlation characteristic between the rain-contaminated radar image and the rain-free radar image is utilized to detect rainfall. However, only the correlation coefficient at a position in the lagged azimuth is utilized, and a statistical hard threshold is adopted. By deeply investigating the difference between the calculated correlation characteristic and the marine radar images, the correlation coefficient in the lagged azimuth can be used to constitute the correlation coefficient feature vector (CCFV). Then, an unsupervised K-means clustering learning method is used to obtain the clustering centers. Based on the constituted CCFV and the K-means clustering algorithm, a new method of rainfall detection from the collected X-band marine radar images is proposed.

Behavioral fingerprinting has gained attention from researchers in this domain as it represents a novel strategy to model object interactions and assess their correctness and honesty. Still, there exist challenges in terms of the performance of such AI-based solutions. The main reasons can be alleged to scalability, privacy, and limitations on adopted Machine Learning algorithms. Indeed, in classical distributed fingerprinting approaches, an object models the behavior of a target contact by exploiting only the information coming from the direct interaction with it, which represents a very limited view of the target because it does not consider services and messages exchanged with other neighbors. On the other hand, building a global model of a target node behavior leveraging the information coming from the interactions with its neighbors, may lead to critical privacy concerns. To face this issue, the strategy proposed in this paper exploits Federated Learning to compute a global behavioral fingerprinting model for a target object, by analyzing its interactions with different peers in the network. Our solution allows the training of such models in a distributed way by relying also on a secure delegation strategy to involve less capable nodes in IoT. Moreover, through homomorphic encryption and Blockchain technology, our approach guarantees the privacy of both the target object and the different workers, as well as the robustness of the strategy in the presence of attacks. All these features lead to a secure fully privacy-preserving solution whose robustness, correctness, and performance are evaluated in this paper using a detailed security analysis and an extensive experimental campaign. Finally, the performance of our model is very satisfactory, as it consistently discriminates between normal and anomalous behaviors across all evaluated test sets, achieving an average accuracy value of 0.85.",NA,True,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0093f965957eceddf5604daf41ea9ae7a48ab245

We propose to eliminate the temporal domain of feature vectors by computing the mean and standard deviation of each variable across all video frames. Thus, each video is represented by a single feature vector of 67 variables. As for the motion vectors, we eliminated their temporal domain by projecting their phases using PCA, thus representing each video by a single feature vector with a length equal to the number of frames in a video. Consequently, complex classifiers such as LSTM can be avoided and classical machine learning techniques can be used instead. Experimental results on the JHMDB dataset resulted in average classification accuracies of 68.8% and 74.2% when using the projected phases of motion vectors and video coding feature variables, respectively.

Early studies focused on defining the correlation/association-based notions, such as statistical parity, equalized odds, etc. However, recent studies reflect that it is necessary to use causality to address the problem of fairness. This review provides an exhaustive overview of notions and methods for detecting and eliminating algorithmic discrimination from a causality perspective. The review begins by introducing the common causality-based definitions and measures for fairness. We then review causality-based fairness-enhancing methods from the perspective of pre-processing, in-processing and post-processing mechanisms, and conduct a comprehensive analysis of the advantages, disadvantages, and applicability of these mechanisms. In addition, this review also examines other domains where researchers have observed unfair outcomes and the ways they have tried to address them. There are still many challenges that hinder the practical application of causality-based fairness notions, specifically the difficulty of acquiring causal graphs and identifiability of causal effects.

To improve the stability and accuracy of streamflow forecasting, a hybrid decomposition-ensemble model named VMD-LSTM-GBRT, which is sensitive to sampling, noise and long historical changes of streamflow, was established. The variational mode decomposition (VMD) algorithm was first applied to extract features, which were then learned by several long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Simultaneously, an ensemble tree, a gradient boosting tree for regression (GBRT), was trained to model the relationships between the extracted features and the original streamflow. The outputs of these LSTMs were finally reconstructed by the GBRT model to obtain the forecasting streamflow results. A historical daily streamflow series (from 1/1/1997 to 31/12/2014) for Yangxian station, Han River, China, was investigated by the proposed model. VMD-LSTM-GBRT was compared with respect to three aspects: (1) feature extraction algorithm; ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) was used. (2) Feature learning techniques; deep neural networks (DNNs) and support vector machines for regression (SVRs) were exploited. (3) Ensemble strategy; the summation strategy was used. The results indicate that the VMD-LSTM-GBRT model overwhelms all other peer models in terms of the root mean square error (RMSE = 36.3692), determination coefficient (R2 = 0.9890), mean absolute error (MAE = 9.5246) and peak percentage threshold statistics (PPTS(5) = 0.0391%).

In MAGIC, binary microlensing parameters are divided into two groups and inferred separately with different neural networks. The key feature of MAGIC is the introduction of a neural controlled differential equation, which provides the capability to handle light curves with irregular sampling and large data gaps. Based on simulated light curves, we show that MAGIC can achieve fractional uncertainties of a few percent on the binary mass ratio and separation. We also test MAGIC on a real microlensing event.

Machine learning gave reasonable predictions when applied to differentiate between the binding modes of kinase inhibitors, promoting a wider application in that domain. In this study, we applied machine learning supported by feature selection techniques to classify kinase inhibitors according to their binding modes. We represented inhibitors as a large number of molecular descriptors, as features, and systematically reduced these features in a multi-step manner while trying to attain high classification accuracy. Our predictive models could satisfy both goals by achieving high accuracy while utilizing at most 5% of the modeling features.

However, expert-oriented DRG grouping is a black box with the drawbacks of upcoding and high cost. Methods This study proposes a method of data-based grouping, designed and updated by machine learning algorithms, which could be trained by real cases, or even simulated cases. It inherits the decision-making rules from the expert-oriented grouping and improves performance by incorporating continuous updates at low cost. Five typical classification algorithms were assessed and some suggestions were made for algorithm choice. The kappa coefficients were reported to evaluate the performance of grouping. Results Based on tenfold cross-validation, experiments showed that data-based grouping had a similar classification performance to the expert-oriented grouping when choosing suitable algorithms. The groupings trained by simulated cases had less accuracy when they were tested by the real cases rather than simulated cases, but the kappa coefficients of the best model were still higher than 0.6. When the grouping was tested in a new DRGs system, the average kappa coefficients were significantly improved from 0.1534 to 0.6435 by the update; and with enough computation resources, the update process could be completed in a very short time. Conclusions As a new potential option, the data-based grouping meets the requirements of the DRGs system and has the advantages of high transparency and low cost in the design and update process.",NA,True,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0098a8f621736d42032e570ba41b21cb6f05d463

Unfortunately, conventional pixel-based classification methods based on spectral response only (e.g., using random forests algorithms) have shown a lack of spatial and temporal stability due, for instance, to variability between individual pixels and changes in vegetation condition, respectively. Machine learning methods that consider spatial patterns in addition to reflectance can address some of these issues. In this study, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, U-Net, was trained for a 500 km × 500 km region in southeast Australia using annual Landsat geomedian data for the relatively dry and wet years of 2018 and 2020, respectively. The label data for model training was an eight-class classification inferred from a static land-use map, enhanced using forest-extent mapping. Here, we wished to analyse the benefits of CNN-based land cover mapping and reporting over 34 years (1987–2020). We used the trained model to generate annual land cover maps for a 100 km × 100 km tile near the Australian Capital Territory. We developed innovative diagnostic methods to assess spatial and temporal stability, analysed how the CNN method differs from pixel-based mapping and compared it with two reference land cover products available for some years. Our U-Net CNN results showed better spatial and temporal stability with, respectively, overall accuracy of 89% verses 82% for reference pixel-based mapping, and 76% of pixels unchanged over 33 years. This gave a clearer insight into where and when land cover change occurred compared to reference mapping, where only 30% of pixels were conserved. Remaining issues include edge effects associated with the CNN method and a limited ability to distinguish some land cover types (e.g., broadacre crops vs. pasture). We conclude that the CNN model was better for understanding broad-scale land cover change, use in environmental accounting and natural resource management, whereas pixel-based approaches sometimes more accurately represented small-scale changes in land cover.",2132,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00995fb3a1faf5846e10223fd51e57d9827fab75

At any time, if there is a need to deploy a change in drilling operations, drilling companies keep monitoring the time-series drilling data to make sure it is not introducing any changes or new errors. Therefore, a solution is needed to predict groundwater levels (GWL) and detect a change in boreholes data to improve drilling efficiency. The proposed study presents an ensemble GWL prediction (E-GWLP) model using boosting and bagging models based on stacking techniques to predict GWL for enhancing hydraulic resource management and planning. The proposed research study consists of two modules; descriptive analysis of boreholes data and GWL prediction model using ensemble model based on stacking. First, descriptive analysis techniques, such as correlation analysis and difference mechanisms, are applied to investigate boreholes log data for extracting underlying characteristics, which is critical for enhancing hydraulic resource management. Second, an ensemble prediction model is developed based on multiple hydrological patterns using robust machine learning (ML) techniques to predict GWL for enhancing drilling efficiency and water resource management. The architecture of the proposed ensemble model involves three boosting algorithms as base models (level-0) and a bagging algorithm as a meta-model that combines the base models predictions (level-1). The base models consist of the following boosting algorithms; eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting (GB). The meta-model includes Random Forest (RF) as a bagging algorithm referred to as a level-1 model. Furthermore, different evaluation metrics are used, including mean absolute error (MAE), mean square error (MSE), and root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and R2 score.

Ten machine‐learning algorithms were enrolled and subsequently transformed into 76 combinations, which were further performed on eight independent cohorts (n = 1218). We ultimately determined a consensus artificial intelligence‐derived gene signature (AIGS) with the best performance among 76 model types. In this model, patients with high AIGS showed a higher risk of mortality, recurrence, and disease progression. AIGS is not only independent of traditional clinical traits [(e.g., American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage)] and molecular features (e.g., TP53 mutation) but also demonstrated superior performance to these variables. Comparisons with 58 published signatures also indicated that AIGS possessed the best performance. Additionally, the combination of AIGS and AJCC stage could achieve better performance. Patients with low AIGS scores were sensitive to immunotherapy, whereas patients with high AIGS scores might benefit from seven potential therapeutics: BRD‐K45681478, 1S,3R‐RSL‐3, RITA, U‐0126, temsirolimus, MRS‐1220, and LY2784544. Additionally, some mutations (TP53 and RB1), copy number variations (7p11.2), and a methylation‐driven target were characterized by AIGS‐related multi‐omics alterations.

With regard to datasets, class imbalance can bias the predictive capabilities of Machine Learning algorithms towards the majority (negative) class, and in situations where false negatives incur a greater penalty than false positives, this imbalance may lead to adverse consequences. Our paper incorporates two case studies, each utilizing a unique approach of three learners (gradient-boosted trees, logistic regression, random forest) and three performance metrics (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve, Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve, Geometric Mean) to investigate class rarity in big data. Class rarity, a notably extreme degree of class imbalance, was effected in our experiments by randomly removing minority (positive) instances to artificially generate eight subsets of gradually decreasing positive class instances. All model evaluations were performed through Cross-Validation. In the first case study, which uses a Medicare Part B dataset, performance scores for the learners generally improve with the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve metric as the rarity level decreases, while corresponding scores with the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve and Geometric Mean metrics show no improvement. In the second case study, which uses a dataset built from Distributed Denial of Service attack attack data (POSTSlowloris Combined), the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve metric produces very high-performance scores for the learners, with all subsets of positive class instances. For the second study, scores for the learners generally improve with the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve and Geometric Mean metrics as the rarity level decreases. Overall, with regard to both case studies, the Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBT) learner performs the best.",NA,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/009c69158bdcccc22291af3c5dfbef9ebda15341

Although the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning has greatly impacted medicine, no tool is better than the application asked of it. Careful deliberation is needed to understand the potential risks to the learning environment of applying NLP to oral presentations. Oral presentations simultaneously serve a number of rhetorical roles: establishing shared knowledge for decision making, an opportunity to practice integrative clinical reasoning, and case-based review of evidence-based medicine. The relative importance of these purposes shifts with the contextual listening audience and other context. It is unclear to us how using a small collection of model presentations could capture this dynamism. Furthermore, evidence demonstrates learners’ persistent tendency to overlook these multiple objectives in pursuit of the singular goal of demonstrating mastery to their assessor (2). Would this tendency be increased or decreased by the presence of a scoring rubric that assessed only for similarity to a static, gold-standard presentation? There is potentially broad disservice to the educational goals of patient presentation. One major weakness consistently identified in instructor feedback is a lack of contextualization that leads students to learn the wrong lessons (3). NLP-based rubrics would preserve this quality. Although artificial intelligence can highlight how the learner’s work was different, it is silent on why the attending made different choices. Those struggling to improve are as adrift in deriving important principles from these differences as they are in more conventional feedback models. Through these patterns, the use of NLP-based feedback can encourage harmful cognitive schema, such as overconfidence. NLP-based feedback would create an artificial but academically consequential benchmark: the idea that one single form of case presentation is most correct. We are concerned about the implicit impact",98 - 99,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/009d4316650695e1e31b22b6077392bf652d347b

Their identification is crucial, and it would represent a fundamental step towards better management of this urgent public health issue. This aim could be accomplished by exploiting the potential of machine learning (ML) technology. In a single-centre study (n = 2567), we used an ML analysis to cluster patients with metabolically healthy (MHO) or metabolically unhealthy (MUO) obesity, based on several clinical and biochemical variables. The first model provided by ML was able to predict the presence/absence of MHO with an accuracy of 66.67% and 72.15%, respectively, and included the following parameters: HOMA-IR, upper body fat/lower body fat, glycosylated haemoglobin, red blood cells, age, alanine aminotransferase, uric acid, white blood cells, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and gamma-glutamyl transferase. For each of these parameters, ML provided threshold values identifying either MUO or MHO. A second model including IGF-1 zSDS, a surrogate marker of IGF-1 normalized by age and sex, was even more accurate with a 71.84% and 72.3% precision, respectively.

However, the patient inflow rate demonstrates seasonality, trend, and variation due to natural and human-made factors. LoS, CoT and CPs are determined by social-demographics factors, clinical and laboratory test results, resource availability and healthcare structure. For this reason, patient flow simulation models developed using stochastic methods have limitations including uncertainty, not recognising patient heterogeneity, and not representing personalised and value-based healthcare. This, in turn, results in a low acceptance level and implementation of solutions suggested by patient flow simulation models. On the other hand, machine learning becomes effective in predicting patient inflow, LoS, CoT, and CPs. This paper, therefore, describes why coupling machine learning with patient flow simulation is important, proposes a conceptual architecture for machine learning integrated patient flow simulation and demonstrates its implementation with examples.",580 - 593,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/009f8a8ce4d9076907ea929761a078ccaefed3b1

An apple has taste and size. However, we choose in single dimensions, simply preferring some apples to others. How can such single-dimensional preference relationships refer to multicomponent choice options? Here, we measured how stochastic choices revealed preferences for 2-component milkshakes. The preferences were intuitively graphed as indifference curves that represented the orderly integration of the 2 components as trade-off: parts of 1 component were given up for obtaining 1 additional unit of the other component without a change in preference. The well-ordered, nonoverlapping curves satisfied leave-one-out tests, followed predictions by machine learning decoders and correlated with single-dimensional Becker-DeGroot-Marschak (BDM) auction-like bids for the 2-component rewards. This accuracy suggests a decision process that integrates multiple reward components into single-dimensional estimates in a systematic fashion. In interspecies comparisons, human performance matched that of highly experienced laboratory monkeys, as measured by accuracy of the critical trade-off between bundle components. These data describe the nature of choices of multicomponent choice options and attest to the validity of the rigorous economic concepts and their convenient graphic schemes for explaining choices of human and nonhuman primates.

Validation using LiDAR data from six U.S. cities showed UT-GLOBUS-derived building heights had a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 9.1 meters. Validation of mean building heights within 1-km2 grid cells, including data from Hamburg and Sydney, resulted in an RMSE of 7.8 meters. Testing the UCPs in the urban Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-Urban) model resulted in a significant improvement (55% in RMSE) in intra-urban air temperature representation compared to the existing table-based local climate zone approach in Houston, TX. Additionally, we demonstrated the dataset’s utility for simulating heat mitigation strategies and building energy consumption using WRF-Urban, with test cases in Chicago, IL, and Austin, TX. Street-scale mean radiant temperature simulations using the SOlar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry (SOLWEIG) model, incorporating UT-GLOBUS and LiDAR-derived building heights, confirmed the dataset’s effectiveness in modeling human thermal comfort in Baltimore, MD (daytime RMSE = 2.85°C).

Observing land-surface parameters in the field is one of the key steps of validation. Therefore, the demand for long-term stable validation stations has gradually increased. However, the current location-selection procedure of validation stations lacks a systematic and objective evaluation system. In this research, a data-driven selection of a land product validation station (DSS-LPV) based on Machine Learning is proposed. Firstly, we construct an evaluation indicator system in which all factors affecting the location of validation stations are divided into surface characteristics, atmospheric conditions and the social environment. Then, multi-scale evaluation grids are constructed and indicators are allocated for spatial evaluation. Finally, four Machine Learning (ML) methods are used to learn the established reliable stations, and different data-driven scoring models are constructed to explore the intrinsic relationship between evaluation indicators and station locations. In this article, the reliability of DSS-LPV is effectively validated by the example of China using the national-level land product validation station that has been established. After a comparison between the four ML models, the random forest (RF) with the highest accuracy was selected as the modeling method of DSS-LPV. The correlation between the regression value of test stations and the target value is 0.9133. The average score of test stations is 0.8304. The test stations are generally located within the calculated hot-spot area of the score density map, which means that it is highly consistent with the location of the built stations. Research results indicate that DSS-LPV is an effective method that can provide a reasonable geographical distribution of the stations. The location-selection results can provide scientific decision-making support for the construction of land product validation stations.",813,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00a5f5c7118176125e9221c717e4bfed75d88402

The gold standard of cancer diagnosis relies on a medical technologist and a pathologist for feature-based analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides. To improve the efficiency of GBM diagnosis, an artificial intelligence model was built based on the TCGA-GBM dataset, and was deployed on an independent dataset collected locally. The support vector machine model showed excellent accuracy with very good sensitivity and specificity. It could potentially be used for GBM diagnosis and future clinical application. Abstract Background: Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most common malignant primary brain tumors, which accounts for 60–70% of all gliomas. Conventional diagnosis and the decision of post-operation treatment plan for glioblastoma is mainly based on the feature-based qualitative analysis of hematoxylin and eosin-stained (H&E) histopathological slides by both an experienced medical technologist and a pathologist. The recent development of digital whole slide scanners makes AI-based histopathological image analysis feasible and helps to diagnose cancer by accurately counting cell types and/or quantitative analysis. However, the technology available for digital slide image analysis is still very limited. This study aimed to build an image feature-based computer model using histopathology whole slide images to differentiate patients with glioblastoma (GBM) from healthy control (HC). Method: Two independent cohorts of patients were used. The first cohort was composed of 262 GBM patients of the Cancer Genome Atlas Glioblastoma Multiform Collection (TCGA-GBM) dataset from the cancer imaging archive (TCIA) database. The second cohort was composed of 60 GBM patients collected from a local hospital. Also, a group of 60 participants with no known brain disease were collected. All the H&E slides were collected. Thirty-three image features (22 GLCM and 11 GLRLM) were retrieved from the tumor volume delineated by medical technologist on H&E slides. Five machine-learning algorithms including decision-tree (DT), extreme-boost (EB), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and linear model (LM) were used to build five models using the image features extracted from the first cohort of patients. Models built were deployed using the selected key image features for GBM diagnosis from the second cohort (local patients) as model testing, to identify and verify key image features for GBM diagnosis. Results: All five machine learning algorithms demonstrated excellent performance in GBM diagnosis and achieved an overall accuracy of 100% in the training and validation stage. A total of 12 GLCM and 3 GLRLM image features were identified and they showed a significant difference between the normal and the GBM image. However, only the SVM model maintained its excellent performance in the deployment of the models using the independent local cohort, with an accuracy of 93.5%, sensitivity of 86.95%, and specificity of 99.73%. Conclusion: In this study, we have identified 12 GLCM and 3 GLRLM image features which can aid the GBM diagnosis. Among the five models built, the SVM model proposed in this study demonstrated excellent accuracy with very good sensitivity and specificity. It could potentially be used for GBM diagnosis and future clinical application.",NA,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00a62b8df60f14a262861724d96b82f8538f8705

Purpose Image-based prediction of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) severity and resource needs can be an important means to address the COVID-19 pandemic. In this study, we propose an artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML) COVID-19 prognosis method to predict patients’ needs for intensive care by analyzing chest X-ray radiography (CXR) images using deep learning. Approach The dataset consisted of 8357 CXR exams from 5046 COVID-19–positive patients as confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for the SARS-CoV-2 virus with a training/validation/test split of 64%/16%/20% on a by patient level. Our model involved a DenseNet121 network with a sequential transfer learning technique employed to train on a sequence of gradually more specific and complex tasks: (1) fine-tuning a model pretrained on ImageNet using a previously established CXR dataset with a broad spectrum of pathologies; (2) refining on another established dataset to detect pneumonia; and (3) fine-tuning using our in-house training/validation datasets to predict patients’ needs for intensive care within 24, 48, 72, and 96 h following the CXR exams. The classification performances were evaluated on our independent test set (CXR exams of 1048 patients) using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as the figure of merit in the task of distinguishing between those COVID-19–positive patients who required intensive care following the imaging exam and those who did not. Results Our proposed AI/ML model achieved an AUC (95% confidence interval) of 0.78 (0.74, 0.81) when predicting the need for intensive care 24 h in advance, and at least 0.76 (0.73, 0.80) for 48 h or more in advance using predictions based on the AI prognostic marker derived from CXR images. Conclusions This AI/ML prediction model for patients’ needs for intensive care has the potential to support both clinical decision-making and resource management.",NA,True,"['Medicine', 'Engineering']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00a667a4dec9bcb07e331ac2b39379bf92e0dadb

However, the traditional methods of surveillance often fall short in effectively identifying individuals, particularly in crowded or dynamic environments. This research addresses the limitations of conventional video surveillance by proposing a machine learning-based facial recognition system. The increasing demand for robust security measures necessitates the development of advanced technologies in video surveillance. Facial recognition has emerged as a promising solution, but existing systems struggle with accuracy and efficiency. This research aims to bridge these gaps by leveraging machine learning techniques for facial recognition in video surveillance. Conventional video surveillance struggles with accurate and rapid identification of individuals, leading to potential security lapses. This research addresses the challenge of enhancing facial recognition accuracy in real-time video feeds, especially in scenarios with varying lighting conditions and occlusions.

This study aims to fill this void by proposing a novel methodology that combines deep learning and computer vision techniques for robust facial recognition in dynamic environments. The proposed methodology involves training a deep neural network on a diverse dataset of facial images to enable the model to learn intricate facial features. Additionally, computer vision algorithms will be employed to handle challenges such as occlusions and varying lighting conditions.

In particular, frequency filtering with the appropriate passbands is essential for enhancing the biomarkers—such as epileptic spike waves—that are noted in the EEG. This paper introduces a novel class of neural networks (NNs) that have a bank of linear-phase finite impulse response filters at the first layer as a preprocessor that can behave as bandpass filters that extract biomarkers without destroying waveforms because of a linear-phase condition. Besides, the parameters of the filters are also data-driven. The proposed NNs were trained with a large amount of clinical EEG data, including 15,833 epileptic spike waveforms recorded from 50 patients, and their labels were annotated by specialists. In the experiments, we compared three scenarios for the first layer: no preprocessing, discrete wavelet transform, and the proposed data-driven filters. The experimental results show that the trained data-driven filter bank with supervised learning behaves like multiple bandpass filters. In particular, the trained filter passed a frequency band of approximately 10–30 Hz. Moreover, the proposed method detected epileptic spikes, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.967 in the mean of 50 intersubject validations.",NA,True,"['Computer Science', 'Biology', 'Medicine']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00a8b159935ee4092907668e23baa3989992ccc9

In this context, TTCAs are highly promising. Meanwhile, experimental technologies for discovering and characterizing new TTCAs are expensive and time-consuming. Although many machine learning (ML)-based models have been proposed for identifying new TTCAs, there is still a need to develop a robust model that can achieve higher rates of accuracy and precision. Results In this study, we propose a new stacking ensemble learning-based framework, termed StackTTCA, for accurate and large-scale identification of TTCAs. Firstly, we constructed 156 different baseline models by using 12 different feature encoding schemes and 13 popular ML algorithms. Secondly, these baseline models were trained and employed to create a new probabilistic feature vector. Finally, the optimal probabilistic feature vector was determined based the feature selection strategy and then used for the construction of our stacked model. Comparative benchmarking experiments indicated that StackTTCA clearly outperformed several ML classifiers and the existing methods in terms of the independent test, with an accuracy of 0.932 and Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.866. Conclusions In summary, the proposed stacking ensemble learning-based framework of StackTTCA could help to precisely and rapidly identify true TTCAs for follow-up experimental verification. In addition, we developed an online web server ( http://2pmlab.camt.cmu.ac.th/StackTTCA ) to maximize user convenience for high-throughput screening of novel TTCAs.",NA,True,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00aae834a851f316cbe599e6236f33bf8bbe7776

Safe driving ensures the vehicle’s and its passengers’ safety, whereas economical driving brings down fuel consumption. Eventually, eco-safe driving that ensures economical as well as safe driving is the best bet. This review paper provides a systematic comprehensive analysis across cross-cutting dimensions such as data collection mechanisms, features affecting eco-safe driving, computational models for driving behavior analysis, driver motivational approaches towards eco-safe driving, exploiting research gaps and opportunities for further research in this domain. Driving behavior along with environmental context, including weather information, road conditions, traffic flow and time of travel, represent the most effective factors for doing eco-safe driving analysis. 82% of reviewed papers recommended OBD as a reliable data collection source, along with supplementary information from body sensors and cameras. The K-Mean clustering is an effective driving profiling technique clubbed with dimensionality reduction techniques based on Random Forest regressor, PCA and autoencoders. Deep learning and ensemble learning-based safety approaches utilizing Recurrent Convolutional Networks (RCN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Decision Tree (DT) have achieved impressive accuracies surpassing 99%, followed by Neural Networks (NN), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) with accuracy ranging from 91% to 96%. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) yielded superior Area Under Curve (AUC of 0.836) for fuel prediction, in comparison to Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Neural Networks (NN). Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) represents fine-grained accurate fuel-prediction methods with accuracy comparable to Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Prominent research gaps identified during this study are the lack of a comprehensive approach covering all aspects related to safety, fuel economy, the scope of improvement in real-time driving risk assessment at appropriate granularity level, missing effective and engaging driving feedback, dealing with uncertain and incomplete driving events, driver’s personal traits affecting driving safety and fuel-economy. The review will help in establishing the readiness of automation of driving analysis for reinforcement of eco-safe driving for various kinds of vehicles plug-in hybrid vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, electric vehicles, and self-driving cars.",NA,True,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00ab030c600d0d730f70b2d34bb862bb00df519b

Recent approaches show that randomness can be taken out by running regressions on a large library of linear and nonlinear combinations constructed from the input data and their time lags and polynomials thereof. However, for high-dimensional and nonlinear data, the number of these combinations explodes.

Understanding the substantial impact of temporal shifts in these data is crucial. For example, COVID-19 vaccination initially lowered the mean age of at-risk patients and later changed the characteristics of those who died. This highlights the importance of understanding these shifts for assessing factors that affect patient outcomes. Objective This study aims to propose detection, initial characterization, and semantic characterization (DIS), a new methodology for analyzing changes in health outcomes and variables over time while discovering contextual changes for outcomes in large volumes of data. Methods The DIS methodology involves 3 steps: detection, initial characterization, and semantic characterization. Detection uses metrics such as Jensen-Shannon divergence to identify significant data drifts. Initial characterization offers a global analysis of changes in data distribution and predictive feature significance over time. Semantic characterization uses natural language processing–inspired techniques to understand the local context of these changes, helping identify factors driving changes in patient outcomes. By integrating the outcomes from these 3 steps, our results can identify specific factors (eg, interventions and modifications in health care practices) that drive changes in patient outcomes. DIS was applied to the Brazilian COVID-19 Registry and the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care, version IV (MIMIC-IV) data sets. Results Our approach allowed us to (1) identify drifts effectively, especially using metrics such as the Jensen-Shannon divergence, and (2) uncover reasons for the decline in overall mortality in both the COVID-19 and MIMIC-IV data sets, as well as changes in the cooccurrence between different diseases and this particular outcome. Factors such as vaccination during the COVID-19 pandemic and reduced iatrogenic events and cancer-related deaths in MIMIC-IV were highlighted. The methodology also pinpointed shifts in patient demographics and disease patterns, providing insights into the evolving health care landscape during the study period. Conclusions We developed a novel methodology combining machine learning and natural language processing techniques to detect, characterize, and understand temporal shifts in health care data. This understanding can enhance predictive algorithms, improve patient outcomes, and optimize health care resource allocation, ultimately improving the effectiveness of machine learning predictive algorithms applied to health care data.

This is because higher-order biomolecular interactions, dubbed as protein communities, may be retained in their (near-)native state, in contrast to extensively purifying or artificially overexpressing the proteins of interest. The distinct machine-learning approaches are applied to discover protein–protein interactions within cell extracts, reconstruct dedicated biological networks, and report on protein community members from various organisms. Their validation is also important, e.g., by the cross-linking mass spectrometry or cell biology methods. In addition, the cell extracts are amenable to structural analysis by cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM), but due to their inherent complexity, sorting structural signatures of protein communities derived by cryo-EM comprises a formidable task. The application of image-processing workflows inspired by machine-learning techniques would provide improvements in distinguishing structural signatures, correlating proteomic and network data to structural signatures and subsequently reconstructed cryo-EM maps, and, ultimately, characterizing unidentified protein communities at high resolution. In this review article, we summarize recent literature in detecting protein communities from native cell extracts and identify the remaining challenges and opportunities.

They are increasingly diagnosed due to the broad application of cranial magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography in the context of headaches, vertigo, and other unspecific symptoms. For each affected individual, it is utterly important to estimate the rupture risk of the respective aneurysm. However, clinically applied decision tools, such as the PHASES score, remain insufficient. Therefore, a machine learning approach assessing the rupture risk of intracranial aneurysms is proposed in our study. For training and evaluation of the algorithm, data from a single neurovascular center was used, comprising 446 aneurysms (221 ruptured, 225 unruptured). The machine learning model was then compared with the PHASES score and proved superior in accuracy (0.7825), F1-score (0.7975), sensitivity (0.8643), specificity (0.7022), positive predictive value (0.7403), negative predictive value (0.8404), and area under the curve (0.8639). The frequency distributions of the predicted rupture probabilities and the PHASES score were analyzed. A symmetry can be observed between the rupture probabilities, with a symmetry axis at 0.5. A feature importance analysis reveals that the body mass index, consumption of anticoagulants, and harboring vessel are regarded as the most important features when assessing the rupture risk. On the other hand, the size of the aneurysm, which is weighted most in the PHASES score, is regarded as less important. Based on our findings we discuss the potential role of the model for clinical practice in geographically confined aneurysm patients.",943,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b12ba1f5107ba1d332f7fddc3653d1defc72a8

DNNs have been recently used for detecting the intended hand gesture through the processing of surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals. Objective: Although DNNs have shown superior accuracy compared to conventional methods when large amounts of data are available for training, their performance substantially decreases when data are limited. Collecting large datasets for training may be feasible in research laboratories, but it is not a practical approach for real-life applications. The main objective of this work is to design a modern DNN-based gesture detection model that relies on minimal training data while providing high accuracy. Methods: We propose the novel Few-Shot learning- Hand Gesture Recognition (FS-HGR) architecture. Few-shot learning is a variant of domain adaptation with the goal of inferring the required output based on just one or a few training observations. The proposed FS-HGR generalizes after seeing very few observations from each class by combining temporal convolutions with attention mechanisms. This allows the meta-learner to aggregate contextual information from experience and to pinpoint specific pieces of information within its available set of inputs. Data Source & Summary of Results: The performance of FS-HGR was tested on the second and fifth Ninapro databases, referred to as the DB2 and DB5, respectively. The DB2 consists of 50 gestures (rest included) from 40 healthy subjects. The Ninapro DB5 contains data from 10 healthy participants performing a total of 53 different gestures (rest included). The proposed approach for the Ninapro DB2 led to 85.94% classification accuracy on new repetitions with few-shot observation (5-way 5-shot), 81.29% accuracy on new subjects with few-shot observation (5-way 5-shot), and 73.36% accuracy on new gestures with few-shot observation (5-way 5-shot). Moreover, the proposed approach for the Ninapro DB5 led to 64.65% classification accuracy on new subjects with few-shot observation (5-way 5-shot).",1004-1015,True,"['Computer Science', 'Engineering', 'Medicine']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b275680fe3507df7895d25fe477f545c538e7d

Unlike past reviews, we focused on the waste generation and disposal phases in which citizens, households, and municipalities try to eliminate their solid waste by applying intelligent computational models. To this end, we synthesized and reviewed 42 articles published between 2010 and 2021. We retrieved the selected studies from six major academic research databases. Next, we deployed a comprehensive data extraction strategy focusing on the objectives of studies, trends of ML adoption, waste datasets, dependent and independent variables, and AI-ML-DL predictive models of waste generation. Our analysis revealed that most studies estimated waste material classification, amount of generated waste per area, and waste filling levels per location. Demographic data and images of waste type and fill levels are used as features to train the predictive models. Although various studies have widely deployed artificial neural networks (ANN) and convolutional neural networks (CNN) to classify waste, other techniques, such as gradient boosting regression tree (GBRT), have also been utilized. Critical challenges hindering the prediction of solid waste generation and disposal include the scarcity of real-time time series waste datasets, the lack of performance benchmarking tests of the proposed models, the reliability of the analytics models, and the long-term forecasting of waste generation.

Transcardial perfusion is instrumental for removing the intravascular fraction of an injected compound, thereby allowing for ex vivo assessment of extravasation into the brain. However, pathological remodeling of tissue microenvironment can affect the efficiency of transcardial perfusion, which has been largely overlooked. We show that, in contrast to healthy vasculature, transcardial perfusion cannot remove an injected compound from the tumor vasculature to a sufficient extent leading to considerable overestimation of compound extravasation. We demonstrate that 3D deep imaging of optically cleared tumor samples overcomes this limitation. We developed two machine learning-based semi-automated image analysis workflows, which provide detailed quantitative characterization of compound extravasation patterns as well as tumor angioarchitecture in large three-dimensional datasets from optically cleared samples. This methodology provides a precise and comprehensive analysis of extravasation in brain tumors and allows for correlation of extravasation patterns with specific features of the heterogeneous brain tumor vasculature. Kostrikov et al. report a deficiency of transcardial perfusion in brain tumor vasculature, which leads to exaggeration of drug extravasation measurements. They then demonstrate how optical tissue clearing can help to overcome this limitation and provide two machine learning-based image analysis workflows enabling detailed quantitative characterization of compound extravasation patterns as well as tumor angioarchitecture in large three-dimensional datasets.",NA,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00b445bcc5c2c31b22716e708865c6baa1cdb370

The triggering system consists of a comprehensive end-to-end pipeline based on Graph Neural Networks that classifies trigger events versus background events, makes online decisions to retain signal data, and enables efficient data acquisition. The triggering system first starts with the coordinates of pixel hits lit up by passing particles in the detector, applies three stages of event processing (hits clustering, track reconstruction, and trigger detection), and labels all processed events with the binary tag of trigger versus background events. By switching among different objective functions, we train the Graph Neural Networks in the pipeline to solve multiple tasks: the edge-level track reconstruction problem, the edge-level track adjacency matrix prediction, and the graph-level trigger detection problem. We propose a novel method to treat the events as track-graphs instead of hit-graphs. This method focuses on intertrack relations and is driven by underlying physics processing.

In basic research, stroke lesion segmentation is necessary to study complex peri-infarction tissue changes. Moreover, final stroke volume is a critical outcome evaluated in clinical and preclinical experiments to determine therapy or intervention success. Manual segmentations are performed but they require a specialized skill set, are prone to inter-observer variation, are not entirely objective and are often not supported by histology. The task is even more challenging when dealing with large multi-center datasets, multiple experimenters or large animal cohorts. On the other hand, current automatized segmentation approaches often lack histological validation, are not entirely user independent, are often based on single parameters, or in the case of complex machine learning methods, require vast training datasets and are prone to a lack of model interpretation. Methods: We induced IS using the middle cerebral artery occlusion model on two rat cohorts. We acquired apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) and T2-weighted (T2W) images at 24 h and 1-week after IS induction. Subsets of the animals at 24 h and 1-week post IS were evaluated using histology and immunohistochemistry. Using a Gaussian mixture model, we segmented voxel-wise interactions between ADC and T2W parameters at 24 h using one of the rat cohorts. We then used these segmentation results to train a random forest classifier, which we applied to the second rat cohort. The algorithms' stroke segmentations were compared to manual stroke delineations, T2W and ADC thresholding methods and the final stroke segmentation at 1-week. Volume correlations to histology were also performed for every segmentation method. Metrics of success were calculated with respect to the final stroke volume. Finally, the trained random forest classifier was tested on a human dataset with a similar temporal stroke on-set. Manual segmentations, ADC and T2W thresholds were again used to evaluate and perform comparisons with the proposed algorithms' output. Results: In preclinical rat data our framework significantly outperformed commonly applied automatized thresholding approaches and segmented stroke regions similarly to manual delineation. The framework predicted the localization of final stroke regions in 1-week post-stroke MRI with a median Dice similarity coefficient of 0.86, Matthew's correlation coefficient of 0.80 and false positive rate of 0.04. The predicted stroke volumes also strongly correlated with final histological stroke regions (Pearson correlation = 0.88, P < 0.0001). Lastly, the stroke region characteristics identified by our framework in rats also identified stroke lesions in human brains, largely outperforming thresholding approaches in stroke volume prediction (P<0.01). Conclusion: Our findings reveal that the segmentation produced by our proposed framework using 24 h MRI rat data strongly correlated with the final stroke volume, denoting a predictive effect. In addition, we show for the first time that the stroke imaging features can be directly translated between species, allowing identification of acute stroke in humans using the model trained on animal data. This discovery reduces the gap between the clinical and preclinical fields, unveiling a novel approach to directly co-analyze clinical and preclinical data. Such methods can provide further biological insights into human stroke and highlight the differences between species in order to help improve the experimental setups and animal models of the disease.",3017 - 3034,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00c0ae2712fe71e33adae73585d1767fe9644513

 Seismic wave propagation forms the basis for most aspects of seismological research, yet solving the wave equation is a major computational burden that inhibits the progress of research. This is exacerbated by the fact that new simulations must be performed whenever the velocity structure or source location is perturbed. Here, we explore a prototype framework for learning general solutions using a recently developed machine learning paradigm called neural operator. A trained neural operator can compute a solution in negligible time for any velocity structure or source location. We develop a scheme to train neural operators on an ensemble of simulations performed with random velocity models and source locations. As neural operators are grid free, it is possible to evaluate solutions on higher resolution velocity models than trained on, providing additional computational efficiency. We illustrate the method with the 2D acoustic wave equation and demonstrate the method’s applicability to seismic tomography, using reverse-mode automatic differentiation to compute gradients of the wavefield with respect to the velocity structure. The developed procedure is nearly an order of magnitude faster than using conventional numerical methods for full waveform inversion.",NA,True,"['Physics', 'Computer Science']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00c26749f30eac748cfb24ec22fe4fef0ac2b7e4

However, when implemented, their generalization are compromised, resulting in lower performances and render healthcare professionals more susceptible into delivering erroneous diagnostics. This study focuses on the use of uncertainty measures to abstain from classifying samples and use the rejected samples as a selection criterion for active learning. For the multi-label classification of cardiac arrhythmias different methods for uncertainty quantification were compared using three Deep Learning (DL) models: a single model and two pseudoensemble models using Monte-Carlo (MC) Dropout and Deep Ensemble (DE) techniques. When tested with an external dataset, the models’ performances dropped from a F1-Score of 96% to 70%, indicating the possibility of dataset shift. The uncertainty measures for classification with rejection resulted in an increase of the rejection rate from 10% in the training set to a range between 30% to 50% on the external dataset. For the active learning approach, 10% of the highest uncertainty samples were used to retrain the models and their performance increased by almost 5%. Although there are still challenges to the implementation of ML models, the results show that uncertainty quantification is a valuable method to employ in safety mechanisms under dataset shift conditions.",252-259,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00c4cc913002ee9f8205100331292655485b6b70

The presence of fQRS has been associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality and arrhythmia in patients with cardiovascular disease. However, current binary visual analysis is prone to intra- and inter-observer variability and different definitions are problematic in clinical practice. Therefore, objective quantification of fQRS is needed and could further improve risk stratification of these patients. We present an automated method for fQRS detection and quantification. First, a novel robust QRS complex segmentation strategy is proposed, which combines multi-lead information and excludes abnormal heartbeats automatically. Afterwards extracted features, based on variational mode decomposition (VMD), phase-rectified signal averaging (PRSA) and the number of baseline-crossings of the ECG, were used to train a machine learning classifier (Support Vector Machine) to discriminate fragmented from non-fragmented ECG-traces using multi-center data and combining different fQRS criteria used in clinical settings. The best model was trained on the combination of two independent previously annotated datasets and, compared to these visual fQRS annotations, achieved Kappa scores of 0.68 and 0.44, respectively. We also show that the algorithm might be used in both regular sinus rhythm and irregular beats during atrial fibrillation. These results demonstrate that the proposed approach could be relevant for clinical practice by objectively assessing and quantifying fQRS.

As a result, seven geometric features, in addition to the 3D coordinates of the point cloud, are chosen to represent the first algorithm layer.

The proposed approach was tested using two points of clouds, one of a flat area and the other of a mountain area.

It depends on soil textural class, depth, land-use and soil management practices; therefore, the complexity strongly limits its estimation on a large scale with conventional-process-based approaches. In this paper, a machine learning approach is proposed to build the profile of the soil water storage capacity. A neural network is designed to estimate the soil moisture from the meteorology data input. By taking the soil moisture as a proxy in the modelling, the training captures those impact factors of soil water storage capacity and their nonlinear interaction implicitly without knowing the underlying soil hydrologic processes. An internal vector of the proposed neural network assimilates the soil moisture response to meteorological conditions and is regulated as the profile of the soil water storage capacity. The proposed approach is data-driven. Since the low-cost soil moisture sensors have made soil moisture monitoring simple and the meteorology data are easy to obtain, the proposed approach enables a convenient way of estimating soil water storage capacity in a high sampling resolution and at a large scale. Moreover, an average root mean squared deviation at 0.0307m3/m3 can be achieved in the soil moisture estimation; hence, the trained model can be deployed as an alternative to the expensive sensor networks for continuous soil moisture monitoring. The proposed approach innovatively represents the soil water storage capacity as a vector profile rather than a single value indicator. Compared with the single value indicator, which is common in hydrology, a multidimensional vector can encode more information and thus has a more powerful representation. This can be seen in the anomaly detection demonstrated in the paper, where subtle differences in soil water storage capacity among the sensor sites can be captured even though these sensors are installed on the same grassland. Another merit of vector representation is that advanced numeric methods can be applied to soil analysis. This paper demonstrates such an advantage by clustering sensor sites into groups with the unsupervised K-means clustering on the profile vectors which encapsulate soil characteristics and land properties of each sensor site implicitly.",NA,True,"['Medicine', 'Computer Science']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00c939869e0b7e2b71bd3f3df509257c336d62dd

Often explanations are given in form of model simplifications or visualizations. However, as shown in cognitive science as well as in early AI research, concept understanding can also be improved by the alignment of a given instance for a concept with a similar counterexample. Contrasting a given instance with a structurally similar example which does not belong to the concept highlights what characteristics are necessary for concept membership. Such near misses have been proposed by Winston (Learning structural descriptions from examples, 1970) as efficient guidance for learning in relational domains. We introduce an explanation generation algorithm for relational concepts learned with Inductive Logic Programming (GeNME). The algorithm identifies near miss examples from a given set of instances and ranks these examples by their degree of closeness to a specific positive instance. A modified rule which covers the near miss but not the original instance is given as an explanation. We illustrate GeNME with the well-known family domain consisting of kinship relations, the visual relational Winston arches domain, and a real-world domain dealing with file management. We also present a psychological experiment comparing human preferences of rule-based, example-based, and near miss explanations in the family and the arches domains.",1799 - 1820,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00ccd7aecb97947375600e2dc71bfff348d3da26

While ML holds great promise, the results from such models are not fully unreliable due to the challenges introduced by uncertainty. An ML model generates an optimal solution based on its training data. However, if the uncertainty in the data and the model parameters are not considered, such optimal solutions have a high risk of failure in actual world deployment. This paper surveys the different approaches used in ML to quantify uncertainty. The paper also exhibits the implications of quantifying uncertainty when using ML by performing two case studies with space physics in focus. The first case study consists of the classification of auroral images in predefined labels. In the second case study, the horizontal component of the perturbed magnetic field measured at the Earth’s surface was predicted for the study of Geomagnetically Induced Currents (GICs) by training the model using time series data. In both cases, a Bayesian Neural Network (BNN) was trained to generate predictions, along with epistemic and aleatoric uncertainties. Finally, the pros and cons of both Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) models and Bayesian Deep Learning (DL) are weighed.

While the best performing predictors are based on machine learning algorithms trained on peptide-HLA (pHLA) sequences, the use of structure for training predictors deserves further exploration. Given enough pHLA structures, a predictor based on the residue-residue interactions found in these structures has the potential to generalize for alleles with little or no experimental data. We have previously developed APE-Gen, a modeling approach able to produce pHLA structures in a scalable manner. In this work we use APE-Gen to model over 150,000 pHLA structures, the largest dataset of its kind, which were used to train a structure-based pan-allele model. We extract simple, homogenous features based on residue-residue distances between peptide and HLA, and build a random forest model for predicting stable pHLA binding. Our model achieves competitive AUROC values on leave-one-allele-out validation tests using significantly less data when compared to popular sequence-based methods. Additionally, our model offers an interpretation analysis that can reveal how the model composes the features to arrive at any given prediction. This interpretation analysis can be used to check if the model is in line with chemical intuition, and we showcase particular examples.

With the use of the fundus images, it could be difficult for a clinician to detect eye diseases early enough.

Thus, for the purpose of identifying various eye problems with the use of the fundus images, a system of automated ocular disease detection with computer-assisted tools is needed. Due to machine learning (ML) algorithms' advanced skills for image classification, this kind of system is feasible. An essential area of artificial intelligence)AI (is machine learning.

Machine learning algorithms for automated image classification can expedite data processing, but image misclassifications may influence inferences. Here, we used camera data for three sympatric species with disparate body sizes and life histories – black‐tailed jackrabbits (Lepus californicus), kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis), and pronghorns (Antilocapra americana) – as a model system to evaluate the influence of competing image classification approaches on estimates of occupancy and inferences about space use. We classified images with: (i) single review (manual), (ii) double review (manual by two observers), (iii) an automated‐manual review (machine learning to cull empty images and single review of remaining images), (iv) a pretrained machine‐learning algorithm that classifies images to species (base model), (v) the base model accepting only classifications with ≥95% confidence, (vi) the base model trained with regional images (trained model), and (vii) the trained model accepting only classifications with ≥95% confidence. We compared species‐specific results from alternative approaches to results from double review, which reduces the potential for misclassifications and was assumed to be the best approximation of truth. Despite high classification success, species‐level misclassification rates for the base and trained models were sufficiently high to produce erroneous occupancy estimates and inferences related to space use across species. Increasing the confidence thresholds for image classification to 95% did not consistently improve performance. Classifying images as empty (or not) offered a reasonable approach to reduce effort (by 97.7%) and facilitated a semi‐automated workflow that produced reliable estimates and inferences. Thus, camera‐based monitoring combined with machine learning algorithms for image classification could facilitate monitoring with limited manual image classification.",NA,True,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00d3fe20fac2376ee1fffe848cdb743f497ea9f8

This paper presents a novel non-objective and data-driven approach for preliminary seismic site-specific classification maps using machine learning (ML) based on affinity propagation (AP) along with a selected set of representative horizontal to vertical spectral ratio (HVSR) curves inside King Saud University (KSU) campus, which is among the main areas in Saudi Arabia. Besides, the proposed model aims to overcome the clustering error due to the dependency of the interpreter’s experience. Measurements of the ambient vibrations were performed to cover the entire campus area by about 307 stations. Recording at each station lasted for 20 minute length and a sample rate of 128 Hz for each station to satisfy the criteria for reliable and unambiguous HVSR results. Frequency and amplification values were used for subsequent site classification by passing messages between data points. The obtained results illustrate that the microtremor spectral ratio can be a remarkably robust tool in determining site effects. Accordingly, the proposed methodology can assist the decision-makers to set the priorities of managing land uses, estimating the earthquake losses, conducting programs for reducing the vulnerability of existing structures, enforcing building codes, planning for emergency response and long-term recovery, and designing and implementing phases of new constructions.",1-1,True,['Computer Science'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00d539742de67d125e9f73433e54ebff9d366fba

Efficacy was assessed by comparing area under the curve (AUC) pre- and post-adaptation. On the digit recognition task, the baseline CNN achieved an average internal test AUC of 99.87% (95% CI, 99.87-99.87%), which decreased to an average external test AUC of 91.85% (95% CI, 91.82-91.88%), with an average salvage of 35% from baseline upon adaptation.

 More than 360,000 people infected with COVID-19 in New York State (NYS) by the end of May 2020. Although expanded testing could effectively control statewide COVID-19 outbreak, the county-level factors predicting the number of testing are unknown. Accurately identifying the county-level predictors of testing may contribute to more effective testing allocation across counties in NYS. This study leveraged multiple public datasets and machine learning algorithms to construct and compare county-level prediction models of COVID-19 testing in NYS.
 
 
 
 Testing data by May 15th was extracted from the Department of Health in NYS. A total of 28 county-level predictors derived from multiple public datasets (e.g., American Community Survey and US Health Data) were used to construct the prediction models. Three machine learning algorithms, including generalized linear regression with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator(LASSO), ridge regression, and regression tree, were used to identify the most important county-level predictors, adjusting for prevalence and incidence. Model performances were assessed using the mean square error (MSE), with smaller MSE indicating a better model performance.
 
 
 
 The testing rate was 70.3 per 1,000 people in NYS. Counties (Rockland and Westchester) closed to the epicenter had high testing rates while counties (Chautauqua and Clinton) located at the boundary of NYS and were far away from the epicenter had low testing rates. The MSEs of linear regression with the LASSO penalty, ridge regression, and regression tree was 123.60, 40.59, and 298.0, respectively. Ridge regression was selected as the final model and revealed that the mental health provider rate was positively associated with testing (β=5.11, p=.04) while the proportion of religious adherents (β=-3.91, p=.05) was inversely related to the variation of testing rate across counties.
 
 
 
 This study identified healthcare resources and religious environment as the strongest predictor of spatial variations of COVID-19 testing across NYS. Structural or policy efforts should address the spatial variations and target the relevant county-level predictors to promote statewide testing.

Common therapeutic agents, such as small molecules and antibodies struggle with insufficient selectivity, stability and bioavailability, leading to poor performance in clinical trials. Peptide-based therapeutics are emerging as promising candidates, with successful applications for cardiovascular diseases and cancers due to their high bioavailability, good efficacy and specificity. In particular, cyclic peptides have a long in vivo stability, while maintaining a robust antibody-like binding affinity. However, the de novo design of cyclic peptides is challenging due to the lack of long-lived druggable pockets of the target polypeptide, absence of exhaustive conformational distributions of the target and/or the binder, unknown binding site, methodological limitations, associated constraints (failed trials, time, money) and the vast combinatorial sequence space. Hence, efficient alignment and cooperation between disciplines, and synergies between experiments and simulations complemented by popular techniques like machine-learning can significantly speed up the therapeutic cyclic-peptide development for neurodegenerative diseases. We review the latest advancements in cyclic peptide design against amyloidogenic targets from a computational perspective in light of recent advancements and potential of machine learning to optimize the design process. We discuss the difficulties encountered when designing novel peptide-based inhibitors and we propose new strategies incorporating experiments, simulations and machine learning to design cyclic peptides to inhibit the toxic propagation of amyloidogenic polypeptides. Importantly, these strategies extend beyond the mere design of cyclic peptides and serve as template for the de novo generation of (bio)materials with programmable properties.",NA,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00db95188df0b491a1e1dd9dce6961dfdc937195

Observations reveal that dispersed and distributed designs of intelligent systems are gaining attraction. Due to the possible complexities of fuzzy logic computations, distributed architectures have the potential to add value to the development of fuzzy systems. However, the absence of best practices and standard methodologies may prevent widespread adoption. By broadening the IEEE-1855 (2016) standard in terms of system definition and data exchange, this research offers a standard solution for building a Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) as a novel method of implementing fuzzy logic systems by means of a cloud-based collecting, processing, and examining data over the web. A comparison between the performances of a stand-alone hardware-dependent solution and a cloud-based solution (known as fuzzy-as-a-service) is performed. The analysis is also carried out on two different cloud service providers and software libraries (Amazon Web Services using JFML as a java-based library and Azure Web Services using Simpful as a python-based library). The analysis and evaluation are performed on a human fall detection scenario involving wearable sensors. The proposed algorithm can identify between fall and non-fall events.

The rapid surge in social media usage has augmented the significance and value of data available on these platforms. As a result, analyzing community sentiment and opinions related to various topics and events using social media data has become increasingly crucial. However, the sheer volume of data produced on social media platforms surpasses human processing capabilities. Consequently, artificial intelligence-based models became frequently employed in social media analysis. In this study, deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML) methods are applied to assess user opinions regarding airlines, and the effectiveness of these methods in social media analysis is comparatively discussed based on the performance results obtained. Due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset, synthetic data is produced using the Synthetic Minority Over-Sampling Technique (SMOTE) to enhance model performance. Before the SMOTE process, the dataset containing 14640 data points expanded to 27534 data points after the SMOTE process. The experimental results demonstrate that Support Vector Machines (SVM) achieved the highest performance among all methods with accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score values of 0.79 in the pre-SMOTE (imbalanced dataset). In contrast, Random Forest (RF) obtained the best performance among all methods, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score values of 0.88 in the post-SMOTE (balanced data set). Moreover, experimental findings demonstrate that SMOTE led to performance improvements in ML and DL models, ranging from a minimum of 3% to a maximum of 24% increase in F-Score metric.",NA,True,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00dd13c34cd7c95c465a83ce11579fd66cfd23dc

With the advent of artificial intelligence, various machine learning models have been proposed for lung cancer detection (LCD). Typically, challenges in building an accurate LCD model are the small-scale datasets, the poor generalizability to detect unseen data, and the selection of useful source domains and prioritization of multiple source domains for transfer learning. In this paper, a multiround transfer learning and modified generative adversarial network (MTL-MGAN) algorithm is proposed for LCD. The MTL transfers the knowledge between the prioritized source domains and target domain to get rid of exhaust search of datasets prioritization among multiple datasets, maximizing the transferability with a multiround transfer learning process, and avoiding negative transfer via customization of loss functions in the aspects of domain, instance, and feature. In regard to the MGAN, it not only generates additional training data but also creates intermediate domains to bridge the gap between the source domains and target domains. 10 benchmark datasets are chosen for the performance evaluation and analysis of the MTL-MGAN. The proposed algorithm has significantly improved the accuracy compared with related works. To examine the contributions of the individual components of the MTL-MGAN, ablation studies are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of the prioritization algorithm, the MTL, the negative transfer avoidance via loss functions, and the MGAN.

Curated ARG databases exist together with assorted ARG classification approaches (e.g., database alignment, machine learning). Besides ARGs that naturally occur in bacterial strains or are acquired through mobile elements, there are chromosomal genes that can render a bacterium resistant to antibiotics through point mutations, i.e., ARG variants (ARGVs). While ARG repositories also collect ARGVs, there are only a few tools that are able to identify ARGVs from metagenomics and high throughput sequencing data, with a number of limitations (e.g., pre-assembly, a posteriori verification of mutations, or specification of species). In this work we present the k-mer, i.e., strings of fixed length k, ARGV analyzer –KARGVA– an open-source, multi-platform tool that provides: (i) an ad hoc, large ARGV database derived from multiple sources; (ii) input capability for various types of high-throughput sequencing data; (iii) a three-way, hash-based, k-mer search setup to process data efficiently, linking k-mers to ARGVs, k-mers to point mutations, and ARGVs to k-mers, respectively; (iv) a statistical filter on sequence classification to reduce type I and II errors. On semi-synthetic data, KARGVA provides very high accuracy even in presence of high sequencing errors or mutations (99.2% and 86.6% accuracy within 1% and 5% base change rates, respectively), and genome rearrangements (98.2% accuracy), with robust performance on ad hoc false positive sets. On data from the worldwide MetaSUB consortium, comprising 3,700+ metagenomics experiments, KARGVA identifies more ARGVs than Resistance Gene Identifier (4.8x) and PointFinder (6.8x), yet all predictions are below the expected false positive estimates. The prevalence of ARGVs is correlated to ARGs but ecological characteristics do not explain well ARGV variance.

Recently, there have been several efforts to study if, and how, Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs) acting in the absence of hardware noise can be overparametrized. In particular, it has been proposed that a QNN can be defined as overparametrized if it has enough parameters to explore all available directions in state space. That is, if the rank of the Quantum Fisher Information Matrix (QFIM) for the QNN's output state is saturated. Here, we explore how the presence of noise affects the overparametrization phenomenon. Our results show that noise can""turn on""previously-zero eigenvalues of the QFIM. This enables the parametrized state to explore directions that were otherwise inaccessible, thus potentially turning an overparametrized QNN into an underparametrized one. For small noise levels, the QNN is quasi-overparametrized, as large eigenvalues coexists with small ones. Then, we prove that as the magnitude of noise increases all the eigenvalues of the QFIM become exponentially suppressed, indicating that the state becomes insensitive to any change in the parameters. As such, there is a pull-and-tug effect where noise can enable new directions, but also suppress the sensitivity to parameter updates. Finally, our results imply that current QNN capacity measures are ill-defined when hardware noise is present.",NA,True,"['Physics', 'Computer Science', 'Mathematics']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00de256aef3203f55a9ea91b029bdf7375f5b2ca

The prediction results of ERα bioactivity were compared by XGBoot, Light GBM, Random Forest and MLP neural network. Two models with high prediction accuracy were selected and fused to obtain ERα bioactivity prediction model from Mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE) and R2. The data were further subjected to model-based feature selection and FDR/FPR-based feature selection, respectively, and the results were placed in a voting machine to obtain Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity classification prediction model. In this study, 430 molecular descriptors were removed, and finally 20 molecular descriptors with the most significant effect on biological activity obtained by the dual feature screening combined optimization method were used to establish a compound molecular descriptor prediction model for ERα biological activity, and further classification and prediction of the Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, Toxicity properties of the drugs were made. Eighty variables were selected by the model ExtraTreesClassifier Classifie, and 40 variables were selected by the model GradientBoostingClassifier to complete the model-based feature selection.

In a single experiment, microarrays or gene expression profiling assesses and determines gene expression levels and patterns in various cell types or tissues. The advent of DNA microarray technology has enabled simultaneous intensive care of hundreds of gene expressions on a single chip, advancing cancer categorization. The most challenging aspect of categorization is working out many information points from many sources. The proposed approach uses microarray data to train deep learning algorithms on extracted features and then uses the Latent Feature Selection Technique to reduce classification time and increase accuracy. The feature-selection-based techniques will pick the important genes before classifying microarray data for cancer prediction and diagnosis. These methods improve classification accuracy by removing duplicate and superfluous information. The Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) technique of feature selection was proposed in this research using bone marrow PC gene expression data. The ABC algorithm, based on swarm intelligence, has been proposed for gene identification. The ABC has been used here for feature selection that generates a subset of features and every feature produced by the spectators, making this a wrapper-based feature selection system. This method's main goal is to choose the fewest genes that are critical to PC performance while also increasing prediction accuracy. Convolutional Neural Networks were used to classify tumors without labelling them. Lung, kidney, and brain cancer datasets were used in the procedure's training and testing stages.

However, these computations are very time-consuming because of numerous evaluations of a representative volume element, which represents the microstructure. In contrast, neural networks as machine learning methods are very fast to evaluate once they are trained. Even the DNN-FE2 approach is currently a known procedure, where deep neural networks (DNNs) are applied as a surrogate model of the representative volume element. In this contribution, however, a clear description of the algorithmic FE2 structure and the particular integration of deep neural networks are explained in detail. This comprises a suitable training strategy, where particular knowledge of the material behavior is considered to reduce the required amount of training data, a study of the amount of training data required for reliable FE2 simulations with special focus on the errors compared to conventional FE2 simulations, and the implementation aspect to gain considerable speed-up. As it is known, the Sobolev training and automatic differentiation increase data efficiency, prediction accuracy and speed-up in comparison to using two different neural networks for stress and tangent matrix prediction. To gain a significant speed-up of the FE2 computations, an efficient implementation of the trained neural network in a finite element code is provided. This is achieved by drawing on state-of-the-art high-performance computing libraries and just-in-time compilation yielding a maximum speed-up of a factor of more than 5000 compared to a reference FE2 computation.

In this paper, a semi supervised learning based image classification method is proposed, which uses a small amount of labeled pathological image data to train the network model, and then integrates the features extracted by the network to classify the image. The results show that the classification effect of the neural network is better than convolution neural network and other traditional image classification models. To some extent, it can reduce the dependence of neural network on a large number of training samples, and effectively reduce the over fitting phenomenon of the network. Through the analysis of the overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficient of different classification methods under different sample numbers, it is found that the overall classification accuracy and kappa coefficient are increasing with the increasing number of training samples.

The first one is the use of the extrusion process for controlled thermo-mechanical degradation of polyethylene for recycling applications. The second is the data-based modelling of such reactive extrusion processes. Polyethylenes (high density polyethylene (HDPE) and ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE)) were extruded in a corotating twin-screw extruder under high temperatures (350 °C < T < 420 °C) for various process conditions (flow rate and screw rotation speed). These process conditions involved a decrease in the molecular weight due to degradation reactions. A numerical method based on the Carreau-Yasuda model was developed to predict the rheological behaviour (variation of the viscosity versus shear rate) from the in-line measurement of the die pressure. The results were successfully compared to the viscosity measured from offline measurement assuming the Cox-Merz law. Weight average molecular weights were estimated from the resulting zero-shear rate viscosity. Furthermore, the linear viscoelastic behaviours (Frequency dependence of the complex shear modulus) were also used to predict the molecular weight distributions of final products by an inverse rheological method. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was performed on five samples, and the resulting molecular weight distributions were compared to the values obtained with the two aforementioned techniques. The values of weight average molecular weights were similar for the three techniques. The complete molecular weight distributions obtained by inverse rheology were similar to the SEC ones for extruded HDPE samples, but some inaccuracies were observed for extruded UHMWPE samples. The Ludovic® (SC-Consultants, Saint-Etienne, France) corotating twin-screw extrusion simulation software was used as a classical process simulation. However, as the rheo-kinetic laws of this process were unknown, the software could not predict all the flow characteristics successfully. Finally, machine learning techniques, able to operate in the low-data limit, were tested to build predicting models of the process outputs and material characteristics. Support Vector Machine Regression (SVR) and sparsed Proper Generalized Decomposition (sPGD) techniques were chosen to predict the process outputs successfully. These methods were also applied to material characteristics data, and both were found to be effective in predicting molecular weights. More precisely, the sPGD gave better results than the SVR for the zero-shear viscosity prediction. Stochastic methods were also tested on some of the data and showed promising results.",NA,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00e04d635cdcde1355c78878207dc09b67f7945c

A typical personal healthcare system acquires vital parameters from human users and stores them in a cloud platform for further analysis. Acquiring fundamental biomedical signal, such as with the Electrocardiograph (ECG), is also considered for specific disease analysis in personal healthcare systems. When such systems are scaled up, there is a heavy demand for internet channel capacity to accommodate real time seamless flow of discrete samples of biomedical signals. So, there is a keen need for real time data compression of biomedical signals. Compressive Sensing (CS) has recently attracted more interest due to its compactness and its feature of the faithful reconstruction of signals from fewer linear measurements, which facilitates less than Shannon’s sampling rate by exploiting the signal sparsity. The most common biomedical signal that is to be analyzed is the ECG signal, as the prediction of heart failure at an early stage can save a human life. This review is for a vast use-case of IoT framework in which CS measurements of ECG are acquired, communicated through Internet to a server, and the arrhythmia are analyzed using Machine learning (ML). Assuming this use-case specific for ECG, in this review many technical aspects are considered regarding various research components. The key aspect is on the investigation of the best sensing method, and to address this, various sensing matrices are reviewed, analyzed and recommended. The next aspect is the selection of the optimal sparsifying method, and the review recommends unexplored ECG compression algorithms as sparsifying methods. The other aspects are optimum reconstruction algorithms, best hardware implementations, suitable ML methods and effective modality of IoT. In this review all these components are considered, and a detailed review is presented which enables us to orchestrate the use-case specified above. This review focuses on the current trends in CS algorithms for ECG signal compression and its hardware implementation. The key to successful reconstruction of the CS method is the right selection of sensing and sparsifying matrix, and there are many unexplored sparsifying methods for the ECG signal. In this review, we shed some light on new possible sparsifying techniques. A detailed comparison table of various CS algorithms, sensing matrix, sparsifying techniques with different ECG dataset is tabulated to quantify the capability of CS in terms of appropriate performance metrics. As per the use-case specified above, the CS reconstructed ECG signals are to be subjected to ML analysis, and in this review the compressive domain inference approach is discussed. The various datasets, methodologies and ML models for ECG applications are studied and their model accuracies are tabulated. Mostly, the previous research on CS had studied the performance of CS using numerical simulation, whereas there are some good attempts for hardware implementations for ECG applications, and we studied the uniqueness of each method and supported the study with a comparison table.

Flares appear unpredictably during the disease course and therapies used are often only partially effective. These challenges are mainly due to the molecular heterogeneity of the disease, and in this context, personalized medicine-based approaches offer major promise. With this work we intended to advance in that direction by developing MyPROSLE, an omic-based analytical workflow for measuring the molecular portrait of individual patients to support clinicians in their therapeutic decisions. Methods Immunological gene-modules were used to represent the transcriptome of the patients. A dysregulation score for each gene-module was calculated at the patient level based on averaged z-scores. Almost 6100 Lupus and 750 healthy samples were used to analyze the association among dysregulation scores, clinical manifestations, prognosis, flare and remission events and response to Tabalumab. Machine learning-based classification models were built to predict around 100 different clinical parameters based on personalized dysregulation scores. Results MyPROSLE allows to molecularly summarize patients in 206 gene-modules, clustered into nine main lupus signatures. The combination of these modules revealed highly differentiated pathological mechanisms. We found that the dysregulation of certain gene-modules is strongly associated with specific clinical manifestations, the occurrence of relapses or the presence of long-term remission and drug response. Therefore, MyPROSLE may be used to accurately predict these clinical outcomes.

However, the applicability of machine learning methods has not yet been fully evaluated. Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of machine learning algorithms in detecting ADR signals of nivolumab and docetaxel, new and old anticancer agents. Methods: We conducted a safety surveillance study of nivolumab and docetaxel using the Korea national spontaneous reporting database from 2009 to 2018. We constructed a novel input dataset for each study drug comprised of known ADRs that were listed in the drug labels and unknown ADRs. Given the known ADRs, we trained machine learning algorithms and evaluated predictive performance in generating safety signals of machine learning algorithms (gradient boosting machine [GBM] and random forest [RF]) compared with traditional disproportionality analysis methods (reporting odds ratio [ROR] and information component [IC]) by using the area under the curve (AUC). Each method then was implemented to detect new safety signals from the unknown ADR datasets. Results: Of all methods implemented, GBM achieved the best average predictive performance (AUC: 0.97 and 0.93 for nivolumab and docetaxel). The AUC achieved by each method was 0.95 and 0.92 (RF), 0.55 and 0.51 (ROR), and 0.49 and 0.48 (IC) for respective drug. GBM detected additional 24 and nine signals for nivolumab and 82 and 76 for docetaxel compared to ROR and IC, respectively, from the unknown ADR datasets. Conclusion: Machine learning algorithm based on GBM performed better and detected more new ADR signals than traditional disproportionality analysis methods.",NA,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00e45b1c655345a954c7efad6e6ad770c70f899e

Currently, risk assessment is based on a range of extensively reported stable risk factors, but critical to dynamic suicide risk assessment is an understanding of each individual patient’s health trajectory over time. The use of electronic health records (EHRs) and analysis using machine learning has the potential to accelerate progress in developing early warning indicators. Setting EHR data from the South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust (SLaM) which provides secondary mental healthcare for 1.8 million people living in four South London boroughs. Objectives To determine whether the time window proximal to a hospitalised suicide attempt can be discriminated from a distal period of lower risk by analysing the documentation and mental health clinical free text data from EHRs and (i) investigate whether the rate at which EHR documents are recorded per patient is associated with a suicide attempt; (ii) compare document-level word usage between documents proximal and distal to a suicide attempt; and (iii) compare n-gram frequency related to third-person pronoun use proximal and distal to a suicide attempt using machine learning. Methods The Clinical Record Interactive Search (CRIS) system allowed access to de-identified information from the EHRs. CRIS has been linked with Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data for Admitted Patient Care. We analysed document and event data for patients who had at some point between 1 April 2006 and 31 March 2013 been hospitalised with a HES ICD-10 code related to attempted suicide (X60–X84; Y10–Y34; Y87.0/Y87.2). Findings n = 8,247 patients were identified to have made a hospitalised suicide attempt. Of these, n = 3,167 (39.8%) of patients had at least one document available in their EHR prior to their first suicide attempt. N = 1,424 (45.0%) of these patients had been “monitored” by mental healthcare services in the past 30 days. From 60 days prior to a first suicide attempt, there was a rapid increase in the monitoring level (document recording of the past 30 days) increasing from 35.1 to 45.0%. Documents containing words related to prescribed medications/drugs/overdose/poisoning/addiction had the highest odds of being a risk indicator used proximal to a suicide attempt (OR 1.88; precision 0.91 and recall 0.93), and documents with words citing a care plan were associated with the lowest risk for a suicide attempt (OR 0.22; precision 1.00 and recall 1.00). Function words, word sequence, and pronouns were most common in all three representations (uni-, bi-, and tri-gram). Conclusion EHR documentation frequency and language use can be used to distinguish periods distal from and proximal to a suicide attempt. However, in our study 55.0% of patients with documentation, prior to their first suicide attempt, did not have a record in the preceding 30 days, meaning that there are a high number who are not seen by services at their most vulnerable point.",NA,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00e7a8c59082af810a5fdbb52af216bcbfcfd0ae

We analyzed registry data from 238,696 persons born and living in Sweden between 1995 and 1999. Several machine learning techniques were used to assess the ability of registry data to inform the diagnosis of ADHD in childhood and adolescence: logistic regression, random Forest, gradient boosting, XGBoost, penalized logistic regression, deep neural network (DNN), and ensemble models. The best fitting model was the DNN, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.75, 95% CI (0.74–0.76) and balanced accuracy of 0.69. At the 0.45 probability threshold, sensitivity was 71.66% and specificity was 65.0%. There was an overall agreement in the feature importance among all models (τ > .5). The top 5 features contributing to classification were having a parent with criminal convictions, male sex, having a relative with ADHD, number of academic subjects failed, and speech/learning disabilities. A DNN model predicting childhood and adolescent ADHD trained exclusively on Swedish register data achieved good discrimination. If replicated and validated in an external sample, and proven to be cost-effective, this model could be used to alert clinicians to individuals who ought to be screened for ADHD and to aid clinicians’ decision-making with the goal of decreasing misdiagnoses.

The cold climate and the albedo effect of snow in these regions present favorable operating conditions for PV cells and an opportunity to realize the seasonal matching of generation and consumption respectively. However, the erratic nature of PV brings a threat to the operation of the grid. PV power forecasting has been used as an economical solution to minimize and even overcome this limitation. This paper is therefore a comprehensive review of machine learning-based PV output power forecasting models in the literature in the context of Nordic climate. The impact of meteorological parameters and the soiling effect due to snow, which is unique to this climate, on the performance of a prediction model is discussed. PV power forecasting models in the literature are systematically classified into multiple groups and each group is analyzed and important suggestions are made for choosing a better model for these regions. Ensemble methods, optimization algorithms, time-series decomposition, and weather clustering are identified as important techniques that can be used to enhance performance. And notably, this work proposed two conceptual approaches that can be used to incorporate the effect of snow on PV power forecasting.

Through accurate identification of 5-methylcytosine (m5C) sites on RNA, researchers can better understand the exact role of 5-cytosine-methylation in these biological functions. In recent years, computational methods of predicting m5C sites have attracted lots of interests because of its efficiency and low-cost. However, both the accuracy and efficiency of these methods are not satisfactory yet and need further improvement. In this work, we have developed a new computational method, m5CPred-SVM, to identify m5C sites in three species, H. sapiens, M. musculus and A. thaliana. To build this model, we first collected benchmark datasets following three recently published methods. Then, six types of sequence-based features were generated based on RNA segments and the sequential forward feature selection strategy was used to obtain the optimal feature subset. After that, the performance of models based on different learning algorithms were compared, and the model based on the support vector machine provided the highest prediction accuracy. Finally, our proposed method, m5CPred-SVM was compared with several existing methods, and the result showed that m5CPred-SVM offered substantially higher prediction accuracy than previously published methods. It is expected that our method, m5CPred-SVM, can become a useful tool for accurate identification of m5C sites. In this study, by introducing position-specific propensity related features, we built a new model, m5CPred-SVM, to predict RNA m5C sites of three different species. The result shows that our model outperformed the existing state-of-art models.

Existing area localization solutions employ a static segmentation into areas that is independent of the available training data. This approach is not applicable for crowdsoucred data collection, which features an unbalanced spatial training data distribution that evolves over time. A segmentation is required that utilizes the existing training data distribution and adapts once new data is accumulated.

The precision of disease staging significantly impacts the therapeutic and curative outcomes for patients, and the diagnosis of multi-clinical-stage diseases based on electronic medical records is a problem that needs further research. Gout is a multi-stage disease. This paper focuses on the research of gout and proposes a staging diagnosis method for gout based on deep reinforcement learning. This method firstly uses the candidate binary classification model library for accurate diagnosis of gout, and then corrects the results of the binary classification through the set medical rules for diagnosis of gout, and then uses the machine learning model to diagnose different stages of corrected accurate data. In the course of the experiment, deep reinforcement learning was introduced to solve the hyperparameter tuning problem of the staging model. Through experiments conducted on 24,872 electronic medical records, the accuracy rate of gout diagnosis was found to be 90.03%, while the accuracy rate for diagnosing different stages of gout disease reached 86.85%. These findings serve as a valuable tool in assisting clinicians with accurate staging and diagnosis of gout. The application of deep reinforcement learning in gout staging diagnosis demonstrates a significant enhancement in diagnostic accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness and feasibility of this method.",NA,True,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00efd20ace8e818606adf59560e5e7c340127623

Utilizing an unsupervised machine learning approach centered on the mRNA expression of pluripotent stem cells as well as its subsequent developed progeny, the mRNA stemness index of further around 500 LUAD patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset was generated. In LUADs, mRNAsi had first been investigated using differential variations, survivability analyses, medical phases, and sexuality. A computational approach is used for identifying cell clusters utilizing fuzzy clustering. There at transcriptional as well as protein stages, the interactions between the genetic markers were investigated. The functionality and processes of the important genes were annotated using expression values. The degree of gene expression related to the clinical symptoms and the likelihood of surviving have also been confirmed. In cancer patients, the mRNAsi genes were highly elevated. In particular, the mRNAsi score rises with advanced trials and varies markedly by sexuality. Within several years, reduced mRNAsi categories will have superior overall survivability in large LUADs. Individuals with chronic LUAD had greater mRNAsi and had reduced average survivability. The important genes and the distinguished categories have been chosen based on their mRNAsi connections. Some of the major genes related to cell proliferating Gene Ontology concepts were found enriched out from the cell cycle Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) process. Specific genes were found to be linked to CSC features. Their activation grew in lockstep with the progression of LUAD's pathology, so these markers appeared amplified in pan-cancers. These important markers were discovered to have substantial connections as a group, suggesting that they could be exploited as drug applications in the therapy of LUAD by suppressing stemness traits.",NA,True,['Medicine'],https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00f0088ec84659600dec03e1a83b13f87c80a0de

Methods We evaluate seven different German bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT) models on a dataset of 857,783 unlabeled radiology reports and an annotated reading comprehension dataset in the format of SQuAD 2.0 based on 1223 additional reports. Results Continued pre-training of a BERT model on the radiology dataset and a medical online encyclopedia resulted in the most accurate model with an F1-score of 83.97% and an exact match score of 71.63% for answerable questions and 96.01% accuracy in detecting unanswerable questions. Fine-tuning a non-medical model without further pre-training led to the lowest-performing model. The final model proved stable against variation in the formulations of questions and in dealing with questions on topics excluded from the training set. Conclusions General domain BERT models further pre-trained on radiological data achieve high accuracy in answering questions on radiology reports. We propose to integrate our approach into the workflow of medical practitioners and researchers to extract information from radiology reports. Clinical relevance statement By reducing the need for manual searches of radiology reports, radiologists’ resources are freed up, which indirectly benefits patients. Key Points • BERT models pre-trained on general domain datasets and radiology reports achieve high accuracy (83.97% F1-score) on question-answering for radiology reports. • The best performing model achieves an F1-score of 83.97% for answerable questions and 96.01% accuracy for questions without an answer. • Additional radiology-specific pretraining of all investigated BERT models improves their performance.

Diabetes is one of the chronic diseases, which is increasing from year to year. The problems begin when diabetes is not detected at an early phase and diagnosed properly at the appropriate time. Different machine learning techniques, as well as ontology-based ML techniques, have recently played an important role in medical science by developing an automated system that can detect diabetes patients. This paper provides a comparative study and review of the most popular machine learning techniques and ontology-based Machine Learning classification. Various types of classification algorithms were considered namely: SVM, KNN, ANN, Naive Bayes, Logistic regression, and Decision Tree. The results are evaluated based on performance metrics like Recall, Accuracy, Precision, and F-Measure that are derived from the confusion matrix. The experimental results showed that the best accuracy goes for ontology classifiers and SVM.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) allows doctors to discover clinical indicators and enhance their diagnoses and treatments. Specifically, “eXplainable AI” (XAI) offers tools to improve the clinical prediction models that experience poor interpretability of their results. This work presents an explainability analysis and evaluation of two HF survival prediction models using a dataset that includes 299 patients who have experienced HF. The first model utilizes survival analysis, considering death events and time as target features, while the second model approaches the problem as a classification task to predict death. The model employs an optimization data workflow pipeline capable of selecting the best machine learning algorithm as well as the optimal collection of features. Moreover, different post hoc techniques have been used for the explainability analysis of the model. The main contribution of this paper is an explainability-driven approach to select the best HF survival prediction model balancing prediction performance and explainability. Therefore, the most balanced explainable prediction models are Survival Gradient Boosting model for the survival analysis and Random Forest for the classification approach with a c-index of 0.714 and balanced accuracy of 0.74 (std 0.03) respectively. The selection of features by the SCI-XAI in the two models is similar where “serum_creatinine”, “ejection_fraction”, and “sex” are selected in both approaches, with the addition of “diabetes” for the survival analysis model. Moreover, the application of post hoc XAI techniques also confirm common findings from both approaches by placing the “serum_creatinine” as the most relevant feature for the predicted outcome, followed by “ejection_fraction”. The explainable prediction models for HF survival presented in this paper would improve the further adoption of clinical prediction models by providing doctors with insights to better understand the reasoning behind usually “black-box” AI clinical solutions and make more reasonable and data-driven decisions.",NA,True,"['Computer Science', 'Medicine']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/00f7ed984ea5f51c22c641031adb2f3b2c0b2846

The proposed approach seeks out a path on the tree during the rule retrieval process, and then figures out several reasoning results according to the nodes on the path. These results are weighted and aggregated to obtain the final conclusion of the system, thus ensure both the efficiency of reasoning and the sufficient utilization of information. In addition, the differential evolution (DE) algorithm is used to train the parameters of EBRB system in this study.

To effectively design targeted marketing strategies to boost insurance adoption, it is crucial to determine the factors that affect insurance uptake among potential policyholders. In this study, the 2021 FinAccess Survey, which interviewed sampled individuals above 16 years in Kenya and machine learning techniques, including Random Forest, XGBoost, and Logistic Regression, were utilized to uncover the factors driving insurance uptake and the reasons for the low adoption of insurance among potential policyholders. Random Forest was the most robust model of the three classifiers based on Kappa score, recall score, F1 score, precision, and area under the operating characteristic curve (approaching 1). The paper explores eight reasons why people currently do not have insurance policies. The results indicated that affordability was the primary driver of uptake with 68.67% of having expressed a desire to possess insurance but are unable to afford it. The highest level of education being the next most significant factor. Cultural and religious beliefs and mistrust of insurance providers were found to have a minimal impact on uptake. These findings imply that offering affordable insurance products and conducting awareness campaigns are critical to increase insurance adoption.",NA,True,,https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/01030ce7d98a98236b5b903611e634bba046f0e5

O-rings accuracy measurement and inspection play a significant role in seal quality control. Human tests can be unpredictable and can take time. The goal of this paper is to use detection algorithms based on machine vision technology to monitor the O-rings norm, which also has the correct measurement rule and the classification rule. During this, we find an entirely different variety of good defects, Material shortage, Bounce, Spiral, and Breakage. Extract values for the elements by using MATLAB. Feature selection optimization attribute choice with MATLAB and classification exploitation of KNN, SVM, call Trees and alternative classifier variety with MATLAB is performed to check for the utmost prediction precision. To evaluate the recorded images of O-rings and conduct the measurement and inspection processes a computer vision program is applied. Then the GUI system is built to interface the user with the credibility of accessing the trained model. The proposed GUI is tested via a sequence of O-rings being checked.",NA,True,"['Physics', 'Computer Science']",https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/0105357320d52d249a9b743afa2624f397d5fa12
